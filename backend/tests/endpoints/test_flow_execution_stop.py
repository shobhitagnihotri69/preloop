"""The stop command is idempotent and shared with automatic stops (#1032).

``POST /flows/executions/{id}/command {"command": "stop"}`` and the pull
request lifecycle stops in ``flow_trigger_service`` run the same code,
``preloop.services.flow_execution_stop.stop_execution``. These tests pin the
parts both rely on: an execution that already ended is left exactly as it
was, a second stop changes nothing, and an automatic stop records why.
