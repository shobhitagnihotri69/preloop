"""The preset sync must not drop a field between create and update.

Presets 006 and 014 declare ``approval_window_seconds: 259200``. On staging
both reported ``None``, and so did a fresh clone of 006, because those preset
rows already existed and therefore only ever took the sync's update path,
whose hand-maintained ``update_data`` dict had fallen six fields behind the
create path: approval_window_seconds, timeout_seconds, runner_pool,
custom_commands, webhook_config and schedule_config.

The consequence is the failure #510 was written to remove.
``resolve_approval_window`` fell back to
``settings.approval_default_window_seconds`` (300s), so the CRA waiver in
execution e42c6086-f637-4d18-be09-2395c4d488ca would have had five minutes to
answer rather than three days, had the operator not patched the flow row by
hand first. Round 1's waiver died that way: answered in 175 seconds, 27
seconds late.

These tests pin the fix from both ends: one source of truth for the field
list, and the specific fields that were lost.
