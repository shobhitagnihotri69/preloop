"""Stopping a parent that is parked on the flows it started (#689).

The decision under test is "the children stop with the parent", so every
test here asserts on execution rows after a real stop: which rows are
terminal, what each one says about why it changed, and what the stopped
parent declares about the coverage it reached. Nothing is asserted on log
output, and the race is driven rather than slept on.
