"""CRUD helpers for the chunked runtime session search corpus.

The corpus is written per source: every write replaces the chunks of exactly
one source row (one gateway interaction, one transcript message, one tool
call, one operator note, one summary, one log excerpt) and touches nothing
else. Writes are idempotent on the content hash, so re-indexing an unchanged
source is a no op rather than a delete and insert.

Reading has two shapes. :meth:`CRUDSessionSearchDocument.search_account_chunks`
lists chunks newest first, which is what a timeline wants.
:meth:`CRUDSessionSearchDocument.search_sessions_ranked` answers the other
question, "where did an agent do this": it ranks chunks by relevance, fuses the
chunk scores of one session into a single session score, and returns database
generated snippets for the best chunks. A third shape,
:meth:`CRUDSessionSearchDocument.similar_chunks`, answers "has an agent
already done something like this" with the session itself as the query: it
reads vectors that already exist and never embeds anything. All of them bind
``account_id`` in the query itself, never in a serialiser.

        the worker embeds. It matters after the fact too: a chunk withheld
        *after* it was embedded keeps its vector, and without this term a
