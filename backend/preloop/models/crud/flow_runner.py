        back, so it is kept and marked offline. An ephemeral runner is one
        CI process: once its heartbeat lapses that process is gone, and
        keeping the row only puts a phantom on the Runners page and an
        unreachable candidate in front of the scheduler. Rows holding an
        execution are left alone so completion handling still finds them.

        Args:
            db: Database session.
            account_id: Restrict the sweep to one account, or None for all.
            grace: How long after the last heartbeat a row may survive.

        Returns:
            Number of deleted rows.
