"""Durable Agent Control command persistence for reconnect redelivery.

``AgentControlCommand`` stores every operator command envelope routed through
Agent Control before any delivery attempt, so agents that reconnect after
downtime can recover missed instructions and delivery can be audited
end-to-end.

State machine (``status``):

- ``pending``: persisted, not yet sent over a live WebSocket.
- ``delivered``: written to a connected agent's WebSocket (locally or by the
  pod holding the connection after a NATS fan-out).
- ``acked``: the runtime plugin confirmed receipt of the command id.
- ``failed``: no delivery channel was available (see ``last_error``).
- ``expired``: still pending past ``expires_at``; never redelivered.

Backward compatibility: runtime plugins that never send acks simply leave
commands in ``delivered`` state — that is expected and harmless. Redelivery
resends the original envelope verbatim (same ``message_id``/``command_id``)
so idempotent plugins can dedupe replays.

Two kinds of row live here (``kind``):

- ``command``: an Agent Control envelope pushed down the control WebSocket.
- ``note``: an operator note, delivered into the model conversation by the
  gateway or handed to a harness hook. Notes never travel over the control
  WebSocket, so every WebSocket query filters on ``kind == 'command'``.

Notes are immutable once written: nothing updates ``body``. Cancelling is a
state (``status='cancelled'`` plus ``cancelled_at``), never a delete, so the
record of "a human said this, then withdrew it" survives.
