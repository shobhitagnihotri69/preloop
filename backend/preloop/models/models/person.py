"""Person: the human behind one or more membership (``user``) rows.

One membership is one ``user`` row, scoped to one account as before. A person
links the rows that belong to the same human, so the same credentials can reach
several accounts with a different role in each. Nothing in this repository
reads the link yet: it is schema for the account hierarchy work (#986).

A person whose ``email_verified_at`` is NULL is provisional. It holds exactly
one row and is never merged into another person before its email is verified,
so pre-registering an unverified address cannot capture somebody else's
memberships. The partial unique index keeps one verified person per address.

A person lives as long as it has a row: deleting its last ``user`` row deletes
it (trigger ``trg_user_deleted``), so an orphan never keeps an address's
verified claim.
