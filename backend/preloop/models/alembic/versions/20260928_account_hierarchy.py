"""Place every account in a tree: parent, root, materialized path, depth.

Revision ID: 20260928_account_hierarchy
Revises: 20260928_cli_session
Create Date: 2026-09-28

First of six revisions for the account hierarchy (#986). Every existing
account becomes a root: ``root_account_id = id``, ``hierarchy_path = [id]``,
depth 0. ``ck_account_hierarchy_depth_max`` is the only place the depth is
limited (one level below the root at launch). Relaxing it also needs a
trigger asserting that a child's path prefix is its parent's path; at depth 1
``ck_account_hierarchy_path_shape`` already forces ``[parent, self]``.

Only ``account`` is touched here. The person backfill on ``user`` runs in its
own revision, so no transaction holds ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on both tables.
Idempotent: every step checks for what it creates.
