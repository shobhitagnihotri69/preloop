"""Constrain the membership columns on user once every row has a person.

Revision ID: 20260928_person_constraints
Revises: 20260928_person_backfill
Create Date: 2026-09-28

Fifth of six revisions for the account hierarchy (#986).

Locking: this revision takes ``ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`` on ``"user"`` first and
holds it to commit, across the full-table scan for ``SET NOT NULL``, the two
foreign key and two check validations, and the ``uq_user_person_account`` and
``ix_user_access_grant_id`` index builds. The row-by-row backfill ran in
``20260928_person_backfill`` without that lock. Every query on ``"user"``
(every login and API request) waits while this runs: 2 to 3 s on one million
``"user"`` rows on a local Postgres 16 (3.0 s cold, 1.8 to 1.9 s warm). If a
stall of that length is not acceptable, or the table is far larger (a
``statement_timeout`` kill is not retried), drain the API first
(``docs/operations/schema-migrations.md``, "When to drain the API first").

Rows inserted after the backfill committed, by pods still running the
previous release, have no person yet. They are linked first, under the lock,
each to a provisional person of its own (``email_verified_at`` NULL), which is
the same thing the ORM hook does for a new row whose address is taken.

Deleting a ``"user"`` row (trigger ``trg_user_deleted``) also deletes the
account access grants whose subject it was, and its person once no row is
left in it. Without the first, a grant would outlive its subject and keep the
inherited rows it created; ``fk_user_access_grant`` is RESTRICT, so a subject
whose grant still has inherited rows cannot be deleted until the grant is
revoked. Without the second, an orphan verified person would keep the
address's verified claim, so a new signup with that address could never get
it.

Idempotent: every step checks for what it creates.
