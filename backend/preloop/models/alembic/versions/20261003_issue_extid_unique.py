"""Merge duplicate issue rows and make (project_id, external_id) unique.

Revision ID: 20261003_issue_extid_unique
Revises: 20261002_chat_connections
Create Date: 2026-10-03

Concurrent webhook deliveries for one provider issue could each insert a row
(#1194). This migration keeps the oldest row per ``(project_id, external_id)``,
re-points every foreign key that references ``issue.id`` to it, deletes the
extra rows and adds ``uq_issue_project_external_id``.

The foreign keys are read from ``pg_constraint`` at upgrade time so
single-column FKs added by plugins are covered too. A composite FK to
``issue`` aborts the upgrade with its name instead of failing later. In core at this revision they are:
``issue.parent_id``, ``comment.issue_id``, ``issueembedding.issue_id``,
``issue_relationship.source_issue_id`` / ``target_issue_id``,
``issue_duplicate`` (four issue columns), ``issue_lifecycle.issue_id``,
``issue_compliance_result.issue_id``, ``issue_cost.issue_id`` and the
security maintenance issue link.

A dependent row that cannot move because the keeper already has an equivalent
row (unique or check violation) belongs to a duplicate and is deleted.
