"""Link every user row to a person and mark it a direct membership.

Revision ID: 20260928_person_backfill
Revises: 20260928_person_membership
Create Date: 2026-09-28

Fourth of six revisions for the account hierarchy (#986). Runs with row locks
only: ``person_id`` is still nullable here, so reads of ``"user"`` and new
rows go on while the backfill runs. Every row it links stays row-locked until
the revision commits, so an update to an existing row (a login records
``last_login``) waits for it. On one million ``"user"`` rows (local Postgres
16) the revision took 40 to 57 s, of which the final ``UPDATE`` was 19 to
30 s. Rows written after this commits are linked by
``20260928_person_constraints``.

* every row is ``membership_kind = 'direct'`` (the column default);
* rows whose normalized emails are equal and verified share one person, whose
  primary row is the one with the most recent login. Only one row per account
  can join a person (UNIQUE ``(person_id, account_id)``); a second verified
  row with the same address in the same account keeps a provisional person
  of its own;
* every other row, including every unverified duplicate, gets a provisional
  person of its own (``email_verified_at`` NULL). A provisional person is
  never merged here, so an address pre-registered without verification
  cannot capture somebody else's memberships.

The normalized email is ``normalized_email()`` below, the same trim set and
lowercasing as ``preloop.models.models.person.normalize_email``. It is spelled
out here because a revision must not change when that module does.

The revision only links rows. It changes no credential and sends nothing:
passwords, passkeys and OAuth links stay on every row. Idempotent: rows that
already have a person are left alone.
