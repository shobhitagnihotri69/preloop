"""The per-account hash chain over audit rows, and the sealer that builds it.

## What the chain is

Every audit row gets a position in its account's chain: a ``chain_seq``, the
``prev_hash`` of the row before it, and a ``row_hash`` over a canonical
serialisation of the row *including* that ``prev_hash``. Changing any field of
a sealed row, deleting one, or inserting one between two others changes a hash
that the next row committed to, and the walk stops at the first link that does
not hold.

The canonical serialisation is
:func:`preloop.cra.evidence_pack.canonical_manifest_json`, the same sorted-key
compact JSON the evidence pack manifest (#511) and the period export manifest
(#559) already hash. One canonical form in the product, not three.

## Why sealing is a background job

The obvious implementation chains inside ``crud_audit_log.log_action``. It is
the wrong one here. It needs the account's chain head under a lock held until
the caller's transaction commits, and ``model_gateway_request`` writes an audit
row per gateway call: that would serialise the highest throughput path in the
product on one row per account, and would let a chain failure fail the action
being audited. Recording the event has to be more reliable than sequencing it.

So a bounded sweeper seals rows off the request path, in ``(timestamp, id)``
order, in batches, the same shape as #559's ``RetentionPurgeSweeper``. The
cost is stated rather than hidden: sealing lags writes by up to one pass, and
a row deleted before it was sealed leaves no gap to find. That is in the docs
next to everything else this does not prove.

## Sequence allocation

``audit_chain_state`` is one row per account, taken ``FOR UPDATE`` for the
duration of a batch. Two sealer passes (two API replicas, say) cannot both
take seq N, and a pass whose transaction rolls back gives the numbers back
instead of leaving a hole that looks like a deletion.

## Checkpoints

Every ``AUDIT_CHAIN_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL`` sealed rows the sealer writes a
checkpoint: the head hash at that sequence, signed with the account's Ed25519
key. This is the part that makes a rewrite detectable instead of merely
laborious. A server that can write the database can recompute an entire
self-consistent chain; it cannot produce a checkpoint from last month whose
signature still verifies, unless it also holds the key. Which, on a
compromised platform, it does. The anchor is only worth what the copy the
customer keeps off the platform is worth.

## The purge

Retention deletes the oldest audit rows on purpose (#559). That is not
tampering and must not look like it, so the purge raises
``pruned_below_seq`` on the chain state and the verifier reports ``pruned``
under that floor instead of a break.
