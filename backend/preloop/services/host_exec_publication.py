"""Managed legacy publication for native Copilot host profiles (#1069).

Scope: one repository, legacy publication, Copilot host profiles whose runner
advertises ``host_publication`` (the local profile sets ``allow_publish`` and
``allow_checkout``). The runner commits and pushes the checkout to the
managed ``preloop/`` branch after the CLI exits successfully and reports a
receipt on the completion envelope. The control plane then opens the pull
request with the bound code-host tracker client and binds it through
``record_opened_pr``. The agent never supplies a pull request URL.

Isolated publication, multi-repository publication and Cursor publication
stay unavailable with explicit validation errors.
