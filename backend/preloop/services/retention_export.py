"""Period export: audit rows, approvals and evidence receipts as one archive.

The purpose is narrow and worth stating. Retention plus a purge means records
eventually go. A customer whose obligation outlives our retention, or who
simply wants their compliance evidence somewhere we cannot reach, needs to be
able to take the period away with them and prove later that what they kept is
what they were given. That is the whole feature: a tar with the rows, a
manifest that names and digests every member, and a digest over the manifest's
member list.

The manifest deliberately reuses the shape #511 gave evidence packs
(:func:`preloop.cra.evidence_pack.build_pack_manifest`): same ``members``
entries, same ``members_digest`` computed over the same canonical JSON. Two
manifest formats for the same idea would be one format too many, and #558
signs exactly one thing because of it.

Since #558 the archive also carries ``signature.json``, a detached Ed25519
signature over the sha256 of ``manifest.json`` as packed, made with the
account's signing key. Verification is: recompute each member's digest,
recompute ``members_digest`` from the manifest, then check the signature over
the manifest bytes with the account's published public key.

What this is not: it is not proof that the rows were true when they were
written. The digests show the archive was not altered after we built it and
the signature shows we built it, both of which are claims about bytes, not
about the world. The signing key lives on the same platform that wrote the
records. Saying so here is cheaper than having someone infer it.

Bounded on purpose: ``RETENTION_EXPORT_MAX_ROWS`` per record class, and going
over is an error telling the caller to narrow the period. A compliance export
that silently drops the rows past a limit is worse than no export.
