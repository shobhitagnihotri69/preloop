"""Derive browser step observations from Playwright MCP tool calls.

When the MCP firewall proxies a Playwright MCP server, every browser tool
call the agent makes is already recorded as a ``tool_call`` activity. This
module turns the same call into a ``browser_step`` row so the session
timeline shows what the agent did in the browser without an adapter on the
agent side. The derived step is an observation of the call the firewall
forwarded. It is not an approval, a dispatch, or proof that the page
reached the state the step describes.

Tool names and argument shapes follow ``@playwright/mcp@0.0.82``, the
package pinned in the browser environment profile
(``docs/guide/flows/environments-and-recovery.md``). A tool this table does
not know is not a Playwright tool for derivation purposes, so a newer
package that adds tools records them as plain ``tool_call`` rows until the
table is extended.

Argument values that can carry secrets (``text`` for ``browser_type``,
``key`` for ``browser_press_key``, ``values`` for ``browser_select_option``)
are never copied into a step. ``browser_type`` records only the typed
length under ``extra.typed_chars``.
