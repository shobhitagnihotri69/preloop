"""Spend outlier alerts: per developer daily spend, model mix and session cost.

Three rules, evaluated from gateway usage (``api_usage.estimated_cost``) and,
when a source is registered, from imported per-user spend that the gateway did
not meter (for example Copilot premium requests, #788):

``daily_spend``
    Yesterday's spend for one user is at least ``daily_multiple`` times the
    median of the days with spend among the previous 28 UTC days. Needs at
    least ``min_history_days`` such days, and never fires on a median of 0.
``model_mix``
    One model whose name starts with an operator-marked top-tier prefix took
    more than ``top_tier_share`` of the user's spend on two consecutive UTC
    days. One expensive day does not fire; two in a row does.
``session_cost``
    One runtime session's total cost exceeds ``session_cost_threshold_usd``.
    Off until the operator sets a threshold.

Each finding is stored once per fingerprint (see
:func:`finding_fingerprint`), so re-running an evaluation is harmless. The
console shows the findings as Attention cards and dismisses them through the
existing ``attention_dismissal`` table:

* ``item_id`` is ``spend:<rule>:<user id>`` (``spend:session_cost:<session
  id>`` for the session rule), stable across days.
* ``fingerprint`` is ``<rule>|<user id>|<UTC day>`` (``session_cost|<user
  id>|<session id>``). A dismissal hides the card while the fingerprint is
  unchanged. A new UTC day that still matches is a new fingerprint, so a
  standing problem comes back the day after it was dismissed. A snooze is the
  exception: it keeps the card hidden until ``snooze_until`` even when the
  fingerprint moves on to a new day.

A card stays open for :data:`OPEN_WINDOW_DAYS` after the finding was detected,
or until a newer finding for the same item replaces it.

Imported spend arrives late (the Copilot import trails by three days) and can
be corrected by a later import, so the daily pass does not stop at yesterday
(#1061). For accounts whose registered source asks for it, it replays the
:data:`REPLAY_WINDOW_DAYS` most recent completed UTC days through the same two
daily rules. The finding's ``day`` is the spend day; ``detected_at`` is when
the evaluation actually ran. A replay reconciles what it recorded earlier for
exactly those rules and days: unchanged findings are left alone (so a
dismissal or snooze keeps applying), changed evidence is written onto the
existing row with its first detection time intact, and a day that no longer
qualifies is stamped superseded and drops out of the open list and the
digest while its row stays as an audit record. When the imported source
fails, nothing is reconciled and only gateway spend for yesterday is judged.
