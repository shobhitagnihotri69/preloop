"""Which agent may note which target, and who may widen that.

An agent to agent note channel with no scope is a way for any agent in an
account to put text into any other agent's next turn. That text is read by a
model, so the blast radius is the other agent's behaviour, not just its
transcript. This module is the answer to "who may do that to whom", so that
enabling ``send_note`` is not itself a decision that needs a threat model.

**The default is descent.** An agent may note the runs it started, directly or
transitively: its children, their children, and so on. Nothing else. Lineage
is the key because it is the only relationship here that Preloop can verify
rather than accept from the caller: ``parent_execution_id`` is written by the
platform when the child execution is created (#626), never supplied by an
agent, while "we are on the same team" is a claim an agent could simply make.

Four consequences, all of them deliberate:

* A **sibling** is out of scope. Two children of the same parent cannot steer
  each other; the parent that started both can steer either.
* A **grandchild is in scope**: delegation is transitive, and a scope that
  stopped at one hop would be widened by inserting a middleman, which is not
  a boundary.
* An **ancestor** is out of scope. A child cannot write into the turn of the
  run that is supervising it.
* A caller with **no lineage** can note nothing. A top level execution that
  started no children, and an enrolled agent that is not running inside an
  execution at all, both have an empty descendant set, so every target is
  refused. This is the quiet case that makes the default safe: no lineage is
  no reach, rather than no restriction.

**Wider than that is a grant, not a setting.** When the default refuses, the
call is put to the tool policy path every other tool call already goes through
(:func:`preloop.services.policy_evaluator.evaluate_policy`) as a rule
evaluation on ``send_note``, with the scope facts visible as arguments
(``note_scope``, ``note_target_relation``, the author and target ids). Only a
rule that explicitly allows it is a grant: the default allow that a tool with
no rules returns is not, or enabling the tool would silently mean "note
anyone". A rule that denies refuses the call, and rules are evaluated in
priority order exactly as everywhere else, so a deny placed above a grant wins.

That choice is what makes a grant auditable and revocable like everything else:
it is a ``ToolAccessRule`` row, it shows up in the policy decision audit, and
deleting or disabling it takes the reach away on the next call with nothing to
restart.

The account boundary is not part of this model and cannot be granted away:
targets are resolved inside the calling agent's account before scope is even
considered, so ``account`` is the widest scope that exists.

Every refusal returns a distinct reason code. The first of a given
author, target and reason in a short window writes an
``agent.note_scope_denied`` audit row, so "my agent cannot reach that run"
has an answer in the record rather than in a log line. Repeats of the same
refusal, and a small per-author ceiling, do not spend the note budget and
do not fill the audit log.
