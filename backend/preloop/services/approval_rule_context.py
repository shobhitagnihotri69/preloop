"""Matched-rule context carried onto approval requests.

Why this exists: when a human reviews an approval request they see the tool
name and the argument values, but not WHICH rule demanded the approval. That
makes a boundary case (``args.amount == threshold``) indistinguishable from a
mid-band one, and it hides a mis-scoped rule at exactly the moment someone is
in a position to notice it.

This module builds a small, durable, JSON-serialisable record of the winning
rule so it can be persisted on ``ApprovalRequest.rule_context`` and rendered
on every approval surface. It is deliberately a *description of what matched*,
never a risk score or a recommendation: we know which expression evaluated
true, and nothing more.

Absence is meaningful. Approvals raised without any rule evaluation (the
``request_approval`` builtin, historical rows created before this field
existed) carry ``None`` and surfaces must simply omit the block rather than
invent an explanation.
