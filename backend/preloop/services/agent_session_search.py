"""The session corpus as a tool: an agent asking what its own sessions did.

The console search answers a human's question. This module answers the same
question for the agent, which is the point of keeping the corpus at all: an
agent that can ask "did I already run this migration" does not run it twice,
and one that can ask "what did I ask this user last week" does not ask again.

Two things are deliberate here.

The default scope is the calling agent's own sessions. An agent reading its
own history is obviously safe; an agent reading everything the account ever
did is a policy decision, so it is a grant an operator makes rather than a
default an agent inherits. :func:`account_scope_granted` is the single place
that decision is read, so widening it is a configuration change and not a code
change, and a call that asks for the account scope without the grant is
refused by name instead of being narrowed behind the agent's back. A silently
narrowed search is worse than a refused one: an empty answer then reads as
"nobody ever did this" when it means "not you".

The answer is compact and capped. A search that returns a page of transcript
spends the context the agent was trying to save, so one snippet per session,
a short one, and a hard ceiling on the whole document. What does not fit is
reported as a count, not dropped quietly.

Nothing here filters by account: the account bound is applied in SQL by the
CRUD query the search service calls, exactly as it is for the endpoint.

Every call is audited, answered or refused, with the agent as the actor and
``source="mcp"`` on the row (#688), so an operator reading the trail can tell
an agent's grep over the transcripts from a person's.
