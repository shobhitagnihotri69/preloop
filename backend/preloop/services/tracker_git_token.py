"""Resolve a git-usable token for a tracker.

A tracker authenticates in one of two ways:

* ``api_token``: a personal access token stored (encrypted) on the tracker row
  and read through ``Tracker.resolved_api_key``.
* ``github_app`` / ``oauth_app``: no token is stored at all. The credential is
  a short-lived installation access token minted on demand from the GitHub App
  installation attached to the tracker.

Every git path (clone inside the agent container, the post-execution push,
PR/MR creation) needs the second case too. Reading ``resolved_api_key``
directly returns an empty string for App-authenticated trackers, which is why
an App-installed repository cloned fine (public repository, no credential
needed) and then failed the post-execution push with "could not read Username
for 'https://github.com'".

The token is returned to the caller and never logged.
