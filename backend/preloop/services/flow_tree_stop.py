"""What happens to the children when an operator stops their parent (#689).

#633 gave a parent the ability to park on the flows it started. It left one
question open, deliberately: an operator stops a parent that is parked on
three running children. Do the children stop with it, or do they finish and
have their results reaped into the stopped parent's record?

**The decision implemented here is: the children stop with the parent.**

The reason is money and the reason is trust, and they point the same way. An
operator who stops a tree stops it because it is costing too much or because
it is doing the wrong thing; a stop that leaves the expensive half of the
work running is not the stop anybody asked for. The alternative, letting the
children finish and reaping them, keeps work already paid for, but it keeps
it for a parent that will never read it: the parked run's agent session is
gone, nothing resumes a stopped execution, and the results would land in a
record nobody is waiting on while the spend keeps climbing with no ceiling an
operator can see. Discarded work is a cost the operator chose. Spend after a
stop is a cost the operator was not told about.

What the operator sees: the parent goes ``STOPPED`` with a coverage record
saying which children had finished, which this stop ended and what the tree
had cost at that moment; each child this stop ended goes ``STOPPED`` with a
``stop_reason`` naming the parent, which is what the execution tree renders.
A child that had already finished keeps its result, its status and its cost,
including one that finished while the stop was in flight.

The concurrency story is one conditional UPDATE per row, the same pattern the
park uses:

* The parent leaves ``WAITING_FOR_CHILDREN`` before any child is touched, so
  a child finishing at that instant cannot claim a park that is already
  closed, and the sweep never sees the row again.
* If that child won the race and a resume execution already exists, the
  resume is stopped as part of the tree: the tree is what the operator
  stopped, and a resume is the parent carrying on.
* Every child write is conditional on the child not being terminal, so a
  child that finished first keeps everything it recorded.

Not here, on purpose: how one execution is stopped (unchanged, this reuses
the durable stop intent the account kill switch already writes), partial
stops, restarting a stopped tree, and any billing adjustment. A child that
was stopped was still paid for.
