"""Per-execution token, turn and USD ceilings (issue #840).

A flow bounds one execution by wall clock (``timeout_seconds``) and, for a
delegated child, by a USD ceiling on its subtree
(:mod:`preloop.services.flow_delegation_budget`). Neither bounds what a
single *parent* run may consume. An operator whose PR reviews range from
167k to 645k tokens asked for a hard ceiling on the run itself, because a
warm runner removes fixed cost but not variable cost.

Ceilings live under ``flow.agent_config["limits"]`` (a JSON column, so no
migration), with three optional keys::

    {
        "limits": {
            "max_total_tokens": 2000000,
            "max_usd": 25,
            "max_turns": 100
        }
    }

The gateway is the enforcement point: every model request for a flow
execution is attributed to that execution through the runtime API key's
``flow_execution_id`` (and to ``ApiUsage.flow_execution_id``), so before it
forwards a request the gateway can sum what the execution has already used
and refuse a request from a run that is already at or over its ceiling.

The deliberate asymmetry: only *already spent* usage is compared, never a
forecast. A request that would cross the ceiling is allowed once, so the last
response completes and the agent can still emit its verdict; the *next*
request is refused. Refusing the crossing request instead would kill a run
mid-sentence and waste every token already paid for. That also mirrors the
unpriced-model ruling in :mod:`preloop.services.model_gateway_budget_enforcer`
— a ceiling that cannot be measured is not a ceiling that was exceeded — so a
run whose gateway usage is entirely unpriced passes the USD check rather than
being refused on a number nobody can compute.

``max_turns`` is counted at the gateway as one turn per model request. No
runtime in this tree exposes a usable max-turns flag today, so the gateway
count is the enforcement; if a harness grows one, it can read the same value
from ``agent_config.limits`` and pass it through as an early stop.

Flows without ``limits`` behave exactly as before: the helper returns an
empty :class:`ExecutionLimits` and callers do no accounting.
