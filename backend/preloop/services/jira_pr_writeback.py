"""Write an opened pull request back onto the Jira issue that triggered it.

Two writes, each best effort and independent of the other:

1. A comment with the pull request URL and branch (``JiraTracker.add_comment``).
2. A remote issue link to the pull request
   (``POST /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/remotelink``). Its ``globalId``
   is derived from the repository, so a later run on the same issue and
   repository updates the one link instead of adding another.

The Jira development panel (``/rest/devinfo/0.10/bulk``) is deliberately not
used: it accepts submissions only from Connect, Forge or on-premises OAuth
integrations that declare a development tool module, which an API token
cannot do.
