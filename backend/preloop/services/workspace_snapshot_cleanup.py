"""Janitor for captured workspace snapshots and Docker workspace volumes.

Retention is a decision, not a leak. Every hosted run stores a tar.gz of
``/workspace`` on its execution row, and the Docker runner leaves a named
volume ``agent-workspace-<execution_id>`` behind. Both are kept for
``WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT_TTL_HOURS`` (24 by default, 0 meaning "delete on the next
pass") and removed after that by :func:`cleanup_workspace_artifacts`, which
the scheduler publishes hourly.
