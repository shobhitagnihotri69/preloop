"""Re-price historical gateway usage rows from stored token counts.

Repricing recomputes ``ApiUsage.estimated_cost`` from each row's persisted
tokens and ``meta_data["usage_details"]`` using the CURRENT price catalog and
account overrides. It exists to:

- fill in rows recorded as unpriced (e.g. before the model appeared in the
  price catalog, or streaming rows recorded with 0 tokens pre-fix),
- apply a newly created/edited price override retroactively on demand.

Budget-spend buckets are deliberately NOT rewritten: spend was charged at
request time and repricing is analytics-only. Rows priced as ``subscription``
are skipped — their $0 cost is correct by construction. Rows whose cost came
from the provider itself are equally off-limits: ``provider`` (the upstream
reported the request's actual cost), ``reconciled`` (backfilled from the
provider's daily activity ledger) and ``imported`` (external spend ingested
as-is) are actuals, and a catalog ESTIMATE must never overwrite an actual —
not even on a full ``only_unpriced=False`` recompute.
