"""Account kill switch: one control to halt all agent activity.

The kill switch is the account-scoped emergency stop (#157). While a scope
is active, the platform refuses the traffic class it covers:

* ``gateway`` — every model-gateway request (OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
  ingress alike) is rejected with a distinct, clearly-attributed 403 before
  any upstream dispatch, and the rejection is recorded on the account's
  usage ledger so rejected traffic stays attributable.
* ``tools`` — every MCP tool call is denied, and pending approvals are
  frozen (their timeout no longer auto-expires them) rather than
  auto-denied.
* ``flows`` — no new flow executions start: triggers are dropped (recorded
  as events), manually triggered runs are refused, and already-created
  PENDING executions are not claimed by workers until the scope is lifted.

Managed running executions receive durable stop requests. Monitors observe these
on their five-second poll and verify runtime termination separately. In-flight
external effects and independent processes bypassing Preloop cannot be revoked.

Reaction time: halt state is cached in-process for a few seconds so the
gateway/tool hot paths pay no extra DB round-trip per request in the common
(not halted) case; toggles invalidate the cache immediately in the process
that served them, and every other process converges within the TTL.

Re-enable is staged: each scope is lifted independently, so an operator can
restore the gateway first, verify behavior, then tools, then flows.
