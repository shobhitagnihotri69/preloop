"""Derive the stable failure category recorded on a failed flow execution.

``FlowExecution.error_message`` is free-form text: a Kubernetes API dump, a
provider stack trace, the tail of a shell script. It tells a user what
happened but nothing can *count* it, alert on it, or route it. Staging showed
the cost of that — 100 failed executions collapsing into nine distinct causes
that nobody could see without reading a hundred messages by hand.

``failure_category`` is the small, closed vocabulary those causes map onto.
It is derived once, at failure time, from the most authoritative signal
available and stored on the execution so the list/detail APIs and the console
can group by it. The precedence is: an explicit category named by the runner,
then structural message shapes that identify the failing layer regardless of
provider noise (a Job name conflict, a wall-clock timeout, a stop, the
completion contract), then the agent executor's full-log analysis verdict,
then provider-message patterns.

The vocabulary is deliberately about *where* a run broke and *who can fix
it*, not about severity:

``runner_conflict``
    The agent Job/container could not be created because its name was already
    taken (Kubernetes 409 AlreadyExists). Infrastructure, always transient.
``runner_error``
    Runtime infrastructure failures, including startup errors (bad manifest,
    quota, oversized entrypoint) and confirmed container memory kills.
``model_transient``
    The model provider dropped, throttled or 5xx'd the request mid-run.
    Retryable, and the reason the run-level retry exists.
``model_auth``
    Credentials were rejected upstream (or by the gateway). Retrying is
    hopeless until a key/subscription is fixed.
``provider_billing``
    The provider refused the call on billing, credit or quota grounds (HTTP
    402, or a 429 whose body names a quota). Hopeless until the account is
    topped up, which is exactly what ``model_transient`` used to promise the
    opposite of: staging showed HTTP 402 "Insufficient Balance" runs chipped
    "model transient: usually works on a retry".
``model_quota``
    Superseded by ``provider_billing``, which is written instead. Kept in the
    vocabulary so executions classified before it still read as something.
``model_config``
    The model rejected the request as configured (unsupported parameters,
    model not bound to the caller's credentials), or the gateway refused it
    because the deployment gave the hosted model no operator tariff. All of
    these are deterministic: the answer is a different model or a BYOK key,
    never another attempt.
``no_confirmation``
    The agent exited 0 but never confirmed completion on either channel. The
    work may well have succeeded; this is Preloop's contract failing, not the
    provider's.
``agent_no_progress``
    The agent ran and reported failure, and the container's post-execution git
    block found nothing to push: no commit, and (for a live run stopped by the
    no-progress guard) not even an uncommitted edit. The run spent its budget
    reading and planning. Nothing upstream broke, so a retry only helps when it
    changes something about the attempt, which is what
    ``agent_config.retry_on_no_progress`` does.
``setup_failed``
    A repository setup command (``git_clone_config.setup_commands``) failed
    after the clone/restore and before the agent ever started. Nothing the
    agent did caused it, and nothing it could have done would have avoided
    it.
``verification_failed``
    The publication gate (issue #428) refused to publish because a required
    check ran and failed. The implementation itself is the problem: the work
    goes back to the agent, not to the environment.
``verification_blocked``
    The publication gate refused to publish because a required check could
    not run (unavailable dependency, exit 126/127, exhausted gate budget).
    An environment gap, like ``setup_failed`` — runnable after bounded setup
    repair, never evidence of broken code.
``tool_error``
    A command or script the agent ran inside the workspace failed.
``agent_error``
    The agent process itself exited non-zero without a classifiable cause.
``budget_exceeded``
    The execution crossed a ceiling an operator set on the run itself
    (``agent_config.limits``): total tokens, USD, or turns. The gateway
    refuses further model requests once the ceiling is reached and the run
    ends here. Unlike ``provider_billing`` (the upstream says "pay us"), this
    is the account's own per-run cap doing its job.
``timeout``
    The execution exceeded its wall-clock budget.
``cancelled``
    A human (or a policy) stopped the run.
``unknown``
    Nothing matched. A growing ``unknown`` share is the signal to extend this
    module, so it is never silently merged into ``agent_error``.
