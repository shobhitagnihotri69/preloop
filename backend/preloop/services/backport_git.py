"""Control-plane Git workspace for the backport flow (issue #961).

The backport flow runs no agent. This module performs the only repository
work it needs: fetch the merge commit of the original pull request, cherry-pick
it onto a new branch cut from each target branch, and push that branch. A
conflict is never resolved here: the cherry-pick is aborted, nothing is pushed,
and the conflicting paths are returned so a person can take over.

Hardening follows :class:`preloop.services.trusted_publisher.CleanGitRepository`:
no system or global Git config, no hooks, no credential helper, no redirects,
HTTPS only, and Git's stderr (which can echo credentials) never leaves this
module. The credential travels as an ``http.<url>.extraHeader`` scoped to the
repository URL, never in the URL itself.
