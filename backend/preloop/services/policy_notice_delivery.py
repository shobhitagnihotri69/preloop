"""Deliver a policy notice (#959) on the channels the account already uses.

Recipients are the policy owners: active users of the account who are its
primary user, a superuser, or hold ``manage_policies``. Channels:

* email, for each owner whose ``enable_email`` preference is on (the default
  when no preferences row exists);
* mobile push, for each owner with ``enable_mobile_push`` on;
* Slack, Mattermost or a generic webhook, when the rule's approval workflow
  (or the account default workflow) is of that type and has a URL. The body
  goes through the webhook outbox like approval messages do.

A notice names the rule, says this rule did not block the call (a later
deny or approval rule in the same evaluation still can), and carries the
redacted excerpt. It has no approve or deny link: there is nothing to decide.
Debouncing happens before this module is called.
