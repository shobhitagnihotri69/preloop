"""Resolve subject ``allowed_models`` entries against account AI models.

Operators write allowlists in the console, which historically persisted
whatever the model picker showed (an AI model display name such as
``Alpha Chat``), while the gateway compared those entries only against alias
spellings (``acme/alpha-chat``, ``alpha-chat``). This module accepts every key an
operator may reasonably have stored for one model:

* a gateway alias or any spelling the gateway resolver accepts for the model
  (``gateway_model_alias_candidates``),
* the ``AIModel`` id (uuid string), or
* the ``AIModel`` display name (case-insensitive, trimmed).

Matching contract (source of truth; CLI and console copies must stay aligned):

1. Non-string entries are dropped, not stringified. After dropping, an empty
   list is unrestricted (same as a missing allowlist). Do not coerce
   ``null``/numbers to ``"None"``/``"3"``: that would turn ``[null]`` into a
   deny-all.
2. A remaining string matches a model when, after trim, it equals:
   - any gateway alias candidate exactly (including the bare identifier tail),
   - the AIModel id case-insensitively, or
   - the AIModel display name case-insensitively.
3. CLI copy: ``cli/internal/cmd/agents_allowed_models.go``
   (``governanceAllowedModels``, ``allowedModelsCoverSelection``).
4. Console copy: ``frontend/src/utils/model-allowlist.ts``
   (``allowlistEntryMatchesModel``, ``findModelForAllowedEntry``), used by the
   agent and API key pages. The console only rewrites a bare tail to a
   gateway alias when exactly one inventory row matches that tail, so two
   imports of the same upstream model are not silently narrowed.

The gateway preflight and the console endpoints share these helpers so the
policy that is written is the policy that is enforced.
