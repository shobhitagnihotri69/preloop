"""Stopping one flow execution: the single code path every stop goes through.

``POST /flows/executions/{execution_id}/command`` with ``{"command": "stop"}``
is the operator's stop. Since #1032 the platform also stops executions on its
own, when the pull request a run is working on is merged, closed or gets a
new head. Both go through :func:`stop_execution`, so an automatic stop tears
down exactly what an operator's stop tears down (the runner assignment, the
agent container, a delegation tree the run is parked on) and nothing is
stopped by flipping a status alone.

Two properties the automatic callers rely on:

* **Idempotent.** An execution that already ended is left as it is: no
  status write, no container call, no command on the bus. A run that
  finishes while its runtime is being torn down keeps its own result, because
  the status write is conditional on the row not being terminal.
* **Says why.** An automatic stop records a sentence in ``stop_reason`` and a
  machine-readable ``stop_source`` (``pr_merged``, ``pr_closed``,
  ``pr_superseded``). The orchestrator rewrites ``error_message`` when the
  agent exits, so the reason lives in columns it does not touch.
