"""Park a flow execution while a human decides, resume it on the decision.

The shape of the problem (dogfood, staging, 2026-09-08): an execution raised a
batched ``ask_user`` for four Go advisories, the human answered in 175 seconds,
and the run was already dead because the platform had been holding a live
container against a 5 minute expiry. Waiting is the wrong verb. A run that has
asked a question and cannot proceed should hold nothing at all.

Three durable steps, deliberately in three different processes:

1. **request** (approval path, ``approval_helper``): after a short in-process
   wait, write ``park_request_id`` on the execution and hand the agent a
   structured pending result telling it to stop.
2. **confirm** (orchestrator monitor): stop the container, capture the
   workspace/session/evidence artifacts the existing resume paths already
   persist, and set ``WAITING_FOR_HUMAN``.
3. **claim** (decision or expiry): claim the parked row exactly once and start
   a resume execution that natively continues the same agent session.

The resume is a normal execution carrying ``_resume`` (the same contract the
PR-comment continuation uses, #490/#419), so Claude/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode
restore their session and workspace. Harnesses that cannot resume a session
get the answer in the trigger payload under ``payload.answers[<request_id>]``
and start fresh; that is a real difference and it is documented rather than
hidden.

Honest limitation: no harness lets us inject a value as the return of a tool
call in a session that was killed. The answer arrives as the next turn, naming
the ``request_id`` and repeating the question so the model can bind it to what
it asked.
