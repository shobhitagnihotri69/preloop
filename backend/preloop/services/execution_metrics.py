    usage rows are priced *later*: the live price lookup and the repricing
    backfill fill in ``api_usage.estimated_cost`` after the fact (issue #209).
    This helper re-derives the stored rollup with the same attribution rule
    the metrics endpoint uses (``action_type='model_gateway'`` rows whose
    ``flow_execution_id`` matches, replay-validation traffic excluded) so the
    per-run number a user sees equals the sum of the usage rows behind it.

    When no attributable row could be priced, the rollup is set to ``NULL``
    ("unknown"), never a placeholder ``0.0`` that would read as "free" —
    matching the metrics endpoint's semantics.

    Executions without any attributed gateway rows are left untouched: their
    rollup may come from the legacy log-parsing path, which this helper has
