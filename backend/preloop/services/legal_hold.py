"""Place and release legal holds, and answer "is this held?".

A legal hold is the answer to "counsel says nothing about this incident may be
deleted while the matter is open". Before this, the honest answer in the
evidence storage guide was that ``legal_hold`` is always false, and the
30 day operational evidence window applied to a run under investigation
exactly as it applied to a run nobody would ever look at again.

Two things happen when a hold is placed, in one transaction:

1. a ``legal_hold`` record with the actor and the mandatory reason, and
2. the derived boolean on the held rows, which is what the purge and the
   evidence janitor actually test.

Both the placement and the release are written to the audit log, because a
hold that can be lifted without a trace is a hold whose absence proves
nothing.

Release does not blindly clear the boolean. An evidence pack can be covered by
its own pack-level hold and by a hold on its execution at the same time;
lifting one must leave the other in force, so the flag is recomputed from the
holds that remain active.
