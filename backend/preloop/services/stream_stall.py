"""Bound the model stream idle wait and name a run that timed out on it.

A custom-provider Codex call waits ``stream_idle_timeout_ms`` for the next
byte of a streamed response before it treats the stream as dropped, then
reconnects up to ``stream_max_retries`` times inside the same call. With the
old fixed 600 second wait, one silent stream could spend most of a 900 or
1800 second flow budget, and the execution only said that it timed out
(issue #872).

This module owns two things:

* The per-flow bound, ``agent_config.stream_idle_timeout_seconds``, and the
  rule that keeps it inside the flow's own timeout budget.
* Reading a timed-out run's output for evidence that the model stream was
  still silent when the budget ran out, so the execution can say so.

The evidence strings were captured from the pinned Codex CLI (0.153.4)
against a local server that accepts the request and never sends a byte:

.. code-block:: text

    WARN codex_core::responses_retry: stream disconnected - retrying sampling
    request (1/2 in 212ms)... retries=1 max_retries=2 sampling_error=stream
    disconnected before completion: idle timeout waiting for SSE
    ERROR: Reconnecting... 1/2
    ERROR: stream disconnected before completion: idle timeout waiting for SSE

The ``WARN`` line only appears when ``RUST_LOG`` enables
``codex_core::responses_retry``, which the Codex script does. Without it, the
``Reconnecting`` lines carry no reason and the idle reason is only printed
once every retry is spent.
