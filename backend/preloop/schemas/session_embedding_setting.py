"""Request and response shapes for one account's session embedding setting.

The read side publishes the whole setting, including the degraded marker,
the deployment default cap and how far the corpus has been embedded, because
an account looking at this surface is asking two questions at once: what am
I sending to a provider, and why has it stopped.

The write side is what the console's opt in card saves: ``enabled``,
``scope``, ``daily_cap_usd`` and, when turning embedding on, the provider,
model and endpoint the text is posted to. Every field is optional so a
client can change one thing without restating the rest. Naming a provider is
still the opt in: provider details are only accepted when the save leaves
the setting enabled, and they go through the CRUD layer where the host
policy lives, so the console cannot store an endpoint nobody validated.

``scope`` and ``provider`` are ``Literal``, so an unknown value is a 422 from
the validation layer rather than a row that quietly embeds either everything
or nothing.
