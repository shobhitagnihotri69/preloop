"""Request and response shapes for ranked search over session content.

The request is a POST body rather than a query string on purpose. The text an
operator types here is whatever they are looking for in their own agent
transcripts, and a proxy access log is the last place that belongs. The two
existing GET search surfaces predate that reasoning; this one does not repeat
it.

``extra="forbid"`` on both the body and the filter block is the other
deliberate choice: an unrecognised filter key is a validation error, because a
silently dropped filter returns a wider result set than the caller believes
they asked for, and they have no way to tell.
