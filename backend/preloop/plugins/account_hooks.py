"""Extension seams for account hierarchy and multi-account membership.

Account hierarchy (subaccounts, grants, sharing, access rules, pooled
billing) is implemented by an extension. A few of its decisions sit on open
source request paths: sign in and password reset, "sign out everywhere",
gateway model resolution, tool policy, runner dispatch, budgets, the kill
switch, the trial gate and usage summaries. Each of those paths consults one
of the registries below.

Every registry holds ``None`` until a plugin registers something, normally
from :meth:`preloop.plugins.base.Plugin.on_startup` (and from
``on_gateway_startup`` for the hooks a gateway-only process consults: H3 to
H7). Registries are read on every call, never captured at import or
decoration time, because plugins start after the routes exist. Call sites test for
``None`` before doing anything, so with nothing registered they behave
exactly as before and issue no extra query. The last registration wins;
registering ``None`` clears a hook.

Isolation is kept by construction: every query still filters on one
``account_id``. Resources owned by another account enter only through the
visibility provider (H3), at the named resolution points, and credentials of
such a resource are resolved on the server from its owner and never
serialized to the caller.

Hooks run inside the caller's transaction and must not commit. They run on
request paths, so they should answer from an index or a per-account cache.

Hooks:

* H1 :class:`LoginRowSelector`: which user row a sign in, verification or
  reset acts on.
* H2 :data:`RevokeFanout`: other user rows whose sessions a revoke also ends.
* H3 :class:`VisibilityProvider`: ids owned by another account but visible
  in this one.
* H4 :data:`Authorizer`: one ``authorize(ctx, action, resource)`` decision.
* H5 :class:`BudgetExtension`: extra budget policies to enforce and extra
  spend buckets to increment.
* H6 :class:`HaltAncestry`: halted scopes an account inherits.
* H7 :data:`BillingAccountResolver`: whose subscription applies.
* H8 needs no registry: usage summary crud takes an optional
  ``account_ids`` list.
