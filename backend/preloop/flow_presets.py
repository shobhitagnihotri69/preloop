"""Flow preset configurations loaded from layered YAML preset directories.

``PRELOOP_PRESETS_PATH`` accepts an ``os.pathsep``-separated list of
directories (e.g. ``/app/backend/presets:/app/presets`` on Linux). Directories
are loaded in order and merged with union semantics:

* Each preset has a stable identity: the explicit ``slug`` key in its YAML,
  falling back to the filename stem minus the numeric order prefix
  (``004-documentation-generator.yaml`` -> ``documentation-generator``).
* On slug collision, the preset from the LATER directory fully replaces the
  earlier one (by-identity override); presets without a collision all appear.
* A preset with ``disabled: true`` in a later directory is a tombstone: it
  suppresses the same-slug preset from earlier directories and is itself not
  included in the catalog.
* The catalog is stably sorted by (numeric filename prefix, slug); on
  override, the overriding file's numeric prefix determines the position.

The ``slug`` is loader-internal identity: it is stripped from the returned
catalog dicts and never reaches downstream consumers.

A single-directory value (the default) matches the historical loader except
that presets are now de-duplicated by slug even within one directory: two
files in the same directory resolving to the same slug (e.g. ``001-triage.yaml``
and ``002-triage.yaml``) collide, the later file wins, and a warning is logged.
