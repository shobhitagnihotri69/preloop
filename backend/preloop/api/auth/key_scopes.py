"""Route limits for API keys whose scopes are MCP scopes only.

Flow execution credentials (``create_flow_runtime_token``), runtime session
tokens and managed-agent credentials are minted with ``mcp:read`` and
``mcp:write``. Such a key is meant for the MCP endpoint and for the runtime
routes that verify their own credentials (model gateway, agent control
WebSocket, native permission checks, operator note pull, browser steps and
artifact capabilities). None of those go through the generic REST
dependency, so on that dependency an MCP-only key is denied unless the route
is on :data:`MCP_ONLY_KEY_ALLOWED_PATH_PREFIXES`.

A device-scoped key is the same idea for opt-in discovery reporting: a key
whose only scope is ``report_discovery`` may reach the discovery salt and
report routes and nothing else, so an MDM job holding it cannot read or
change the account. The MCP bearer backend and the model gateway do not
use this REST dependency, so they refuse a device-scoped key themselves.

Keys without scopes (personal API keys) and keys with any other scope keep
their previous behaviour.
