# Vendored API documentation assets

`/docs/api` (Swagger UI) and `/docs/redoc` (ReDoc) are served entirely from
the API origin. These files are checked in so the pages render on air-gapped
or egress-restricted installs, and so a strict Content-Security-Policy does not
have to allow a third-party CDN.

The versions match the ones this repository pinned before the assets were
vendored. They are served by a `/static` mount in
`backend/preloop/api/app.py`.

## Files

`SHA256SUMS` is the machine-readable manifest for the four served files;
`backend/tests/api/test_docs_self_contained.py` verifies it.

The `*.LICENSE` / `*.LICENSE.txt` / `*.NOTICE` files carry the upstream
notices required by the Apache-2.0 and MIT licenses. `swagger-ui.NOTICE` is
the upstream file; note that `swagger-ui-dist@5.9.0` does not ship the
`swagger-ui-bundle.js.LICENSE.txt` its banner refers to, so the package
`LICENSE` and `NOTICE` are vendored instead.

## Remaining off-origin request

ReDoc 2.0.0 hardcodes a sidebar logo at
`https://cdn.redoc.ly/redoc/logo-mini.svg` and hides the image when that
request fails. FastAPI's `get_redoc_html` has no option for that URL, and the
bundle stays the upstream bytes so `SHA256SUMS` still proves provenance. The
docs page renders without the logo. `test_redoc_bundle_has_one_known_off_origin_logo`
fails if a second copy of that URL appears.

## Updating

1. Pick the new version and download each bundle from the CDN, e.g.
   `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swagger-ui-dist@<version>/swagger-ui-bundle.js`.
2. Cross-check the download against a second registry (unpkg) before trusting
   it, then update `SHA256SUMS`.
3. Update the table above and the version comments in
   `backend/preloop/api/app.py`.
4. Refresh the matching license and notice files.
