# Preloop Development Guide

Only use the DB models defined in the preloop.models package `from preloop.models import models`
Do not access the DB directly in backend code. Always use the CRUD layer at `preloop.models.crud`

Use the Lit.dev framework for frontend code. If you create new web components ensure that the landing page content is not hidden in their shadow DOM.

## Commands
- **Activate venv**: `source .venv/bin/activate || source ../.venv/bin/activate`
- **Install**: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- **Run server**: `python -m preloop.server`
- **Run tests**: `pytest`
- **Run single test**: `pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py::TestClass::test_function`
- **Lint**: `ruff check .`
- **Format**: `ruff format .`
- **Type check**: `mypy backend tests`
- **Docker development**: `docker compose up`
- **Native (no Docker)**: `docs/native-dev.md` (single VM or host)
- **Install pre-commit**: `pre-commit install`
- **PostgreSQL access**: `docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d preloop`
- **Database migrations**: `alembic upgrade head` (from backend/preloop/models)

## CLI dev builds

- The only sanctioned way to update a local dev CLI is `cd cli && make install-local` (builds, then `install -m 755 build/preloop ~/.local/bin/preloop`; `PREFIX`, `BINDIR`, `INSTALL_MODE` override the defaults).
- Never `cp` a build onto `~/.local/bin/preloop`. `cp` writes into the existing inode, which invalidates the macOS code-signature cache; the next exec dies with `SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)`. `install(1)` unlinks and recreates the file, which is what keeps that cache valid.
- Never `go build -o ~/.local/bin/preloop` either: it skips the version ldflags (the binary reports the compiled-in fallback version and looks like a release to the update check) and it replaces the file even when the target is read-only, so the guard below does not catch it.
- On macOS dev machines keep the binary guarded with `chmod a-w ~/.local/bin/preloop` (or install with `INSTALL_MODE=555`; the default 755 install drops the guard, so re-apply it). `make install-local` still works on a read-only target, a stray `cp` is refused, and `preloop update` honours the guard instead of replacing a dev build with the release.
- A dev build reports the `git describe` version (`v0.15.0-678-g5c9e8bc3`), which the CLI treats as newer than the `0.15.0` release; `preloop update --check` prints `newer than latest release` for it.

## Git Workflow

- Push only to the existing source branch of a PR you opened or were asked to finish. Any other push still requires an explicit user request. Do not merge the PR, force-push, rewrite history, or change draft/ready status.
- After making significant changes, consider their impact on README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md and update these files accordingly.

### Pull request completion contract

Opening a pull request is not the end of the task. An agent that opens or updates a PR stays on it until the PR is clean or the wait runs out:

- Poll the PR every 2 minutes. On each pass check, against the **current head**: unresolved review threads, unaddressed items in the reviewer's summary comment, CI checks (failed or still pending), merge conflicts with the base branch, and code-quality or security findings (CodeQL, the PR reviewer's severity markers).
- Address every item: fix it or reply with a reason and resolve the thread. Never resolve a thread silently, and never dismiss a finding without saying why.
- Every push resets the wait, because a fix can introduce a new finding. Re-run `pre-commit run --files <changed files>` before each commit. Those pushes stay on this PR's existing source branch.
- Exit only when (a) all five checks are clean on the current head, or (b) 30 minutes have passed with no new review, comment or check result and nothing is pending, or (c) a hard ceiling of 90 minutes is reached.
- Report which exit fired, with the head SHA: "clean", "timed out waiting for review", or "ceiling reached with N open items". A PR that was left with open items is reported as unfinished, not as done.

## Keep sample data generic
This repository is public, so anything written here is written for a general
audience. In commit messages, PR and issue text, comments, docstrings,
fixtures and changelog entries, prefer generic examples over data copied from
a real deployment:

- use `example.com` addresses and placeholder names such as `Jane Doe`
- describe a configuration by its shape ("a user configured an
  OpenAI-compatible provider"), not by whose it is
- use synthetic ids in fixtures rather than real account, tracker or project
  identifiers
- keep infrastructure sizing (replica counts, resource limits, database
  tuning) in deployment config and internal runbooks, not in prose

Generic examples read better anyway: they describe the case under test
instead of an anecdote the reader has no context for. Citing a public issue
number is fine and usually more useful than restating its background.

## Code Style
- **Formatting**: Ruff format with 88 character line length
- **Imports**: Use isort with black profile, group stdlib/third-party/local
- **Types**: Use strict typing with mypy, all functions must have type annotations
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Error handling**: Use specific exceptions, log with appropriate level, handle async errors properly
- **Docstrings**: Google-style with type annotations, document params, returns, raises
- **Async**: Use async for I/O-bound operations, run_async utility for sync contexts
- **Testing**: All code changes should have corresponding tests. Use red/green TDD when possible.
- **Dependencies**: `[project].dependencies` lists only packages a core module imports. Packages used only by Enterprise Edition plugins go in the `ee` extra (the EE image installs `".[ee]"`). After any `pyproject.toml` change, recompile the three hash-pinned locks with the `uv pip compile` command in each lock's header.
- **Test telemetry**: ALL test scripts, rigs, and scripted runs must set `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` (CLI, installers, and instance `.env`) so test traffic never pollutes funnel/adoption telemetry.

## Pre-commit Hooks
The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. These hooks run automatically before each commit and include:
- Code formatting with ruff format
- Import sorting with isort
- Linting with ruff
- Various file checks (trailing whitespace, YAML validity, etc.)

To use pre-commit:
1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
2. Install the hooks: `pre-commit install`
3. The hooks will run automatically on git commit
4. To run hooks manually: `pre-commit run --all-files`
5. Activate venv before committing or running pre-commit

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

This is a native VM (no Docker). Follow `docs/native-dev.md`.
`.cursor/environment.json` builds `Dockerfile.dev` (system packages only),
runs `scripts/native-dev-install.sh` to refresh app deps, and
`scripts/native-dev-deps.sh` to start PostgreSQL and NATS.
