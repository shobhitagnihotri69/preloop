# Code signing policy

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io/),
certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

## Signed release provenance

Since v0.15.0, GitHub release assets carry Sigstore build provenance generated
with the Release workflow's GitHub OIDC identity. This covers all attached CLI
binaries, Python packages, Helm charts, installers, Compose configuration,
SBOMs, and the checksum manifest. See [release verification](release-verification.md)
for verification commands and coverage limits.

## Windows Authenticode

Windows CLI release binaries published on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/preloop/preloop/releases):

- `preloop-windows-amd64.exe`
- `preloop-windows-arm64.exe`

These artifacts are built by GitHub Actions from this repository on version
tags (`v*`). When SignPath credentials and policy are configured, they are
submitted for Authenticode signing before attachment to the release. Otherwise
the workflow warns and publishes them without Authenticode signatures. macOS
and Linux binaries use the Sigstore provenance above, not Authenticode.

See also [windows-code-signing.md](./windows-code-signing.md) for CI wiring and
maintainer setup.
