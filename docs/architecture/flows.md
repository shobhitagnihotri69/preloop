# Event-Driven Agentic Flows

This chapter covers the Flow subsystem: the Trigger Service, Flow Orchestrator, NATS queue, agent infrastructure, and data flows. Remote runners, matrix/batch fan-out, eval result artifacts, and evidence packs are included here.

Private runners are the default. `resolve_runner_pool` picks a pool in this order: trigger `_runner` override, `flow.runner_pool`, `account.default_runner_pool`, any online private runner (`auto`), then the hosted executor. The literal `server` at any explicit level opts into hosted compute. A resolved private pool uses `RemoteRunnerExecutor` to lease work to a matching self-hosted runner; if no runner in that pool has a free slot the job queues for 15 minutes (`DEFAULT_QUEUE_TIMEOUT`) and then fails. A runner holds `min(owner ceiling, what the process reports)` executions at once (default 2), one row per lease in `flow_runner_assignment`, and dispatch prefers the runner with the most free slots. Runners maintain an outbound WebSocket control plane for leases, heartbeats, status, logs, completion, and halt requests; durable lease metadata stays in PostgreSQL so temporary disconnects can recover without persisting short-lived API tokens. The CLI (`preloop runner fg`) redials that socket on unexpected close and keeps an in-flight Docker job, sending `complete`/`logs` after reconnect. Register/connect/disconnect also publish `runner_updated` on `account-updates.{account_id}` so the console Runners page updates without a refresh. When `agent_config.execution_path` is `persistent`, `create_executor_for_execution` selects `AgentControlExecutor` before that pool resolution and delivers the rendered prompt as one audited Agent Control `send_message` to `target_agent_id`; see [Persistent flow execution](../guide/flows/persistent-execution.md).

Private Docker jobs carry a versioned transient launch specification generated
by the hosted Codex/OpenCode adapters. Reconnect delivery rebuilds credentials
and rejects changed leased configuration; scripts and credential environments
are excluded from persisted lease JSON. Docker runs an explicit bootstrap,
clears stale reports, and requires both exit zero and a recognized structured
`result.json` verdict. The API checks this again before accepting success.
The private protocol exports only the bounded report, not workspace archives.
Unsupported harnesses fail explicitly. See the [runner image contract](../guide/runners/quickstart-linux.md#what-the-runner-executes).

The default private-runner job is still `docker run` of the flow image (or a custom `image` / `docker_image`). An opt-in **host execution profile** is a distinct private-only path: the runner advertises named local CLIs, the flow selects a name (`agent_config.host_exec_profile` with `agent_type: cursor`), and the host executes that fixed command under the operator's local login. Hosted compute rejects it. Native success uses `completion_protocol: host_exec` (structured Cursor stream-json result plus exit 0) and must not be treated as Docker launch v1. Remote checkout/setup, custom commands, workspace seeds, isolated publication and native CLI `--resume` fail closed on this path. Each job starts in a fresh empty directory. The workspace root controls working-directory placement, not filesystem isolation; Cursor has the runner user's local login, configuration, hooks and filesystem access. Flow MCP tool/server settings are not injected as a sandbox. Profiles advertise supported requested model identifiers mapped to local aliases; actual model attribution requires an observed Cursor result. This is not Agent Control and not `preloop cursor`.

## Ad-hoc preset runs

`POST /api/v1/flows/run-preset` runs a catalog preset on a GitHub or GitLab issue without waiting for a tracker webhook. `confirm_create=false` only resolves the account flow (409 `flow_missing` when none exists). `confirm_create=true` clones the preset on first use, then triggers it. The auto-created flow has empty `trigger_event_types` and no `trigger_event_source`, so tracker events do not start extra runs until the operator edits the flow. Other tracker types (for example Jira) return 400.

## Prompt placeholders

Flow `prompt_template` strings are resolved before the agent starts. Besides `{{project.*}}`, `{{account.*}}`, and `{{trigger_event.*}}`, an execution resolver provides:

*   `{{execution.id}}` — this run's id.
*   `{{execution.url}}` — console URL `{PRELOOP_URL}/console/flows/executions/{id}`.
*   `{{execution.resume_from}}` — prior execution id when this run was started from a human comment on a PR this flow opened. Empty otherwise.
*   `{{execution.ci_failure}}` — when this run was started because GitHub CI failed on a PR this flow opened: provider, job name, and check URL. Empty otherwise.

Any placeholder may take a `|truncate(N)` filter, for example
`{{trigger_event.payload.object_attributes.description|truncate(16384)}}`.
`N` is a byte cap (not a character count) so it matches the launch-payload
and tokenizer costs that actually grow. The cut is on a UTF-8 boundary.
`{{name|truncate}}` without `N` uses 16 KiB. When the resolved value is
longer, the injected text is the prefix plus:

```
[truncated by Preloop: showing the first N bytes of TOTAL; fetch the full text
with the tool that owns this object, for example get_pull_request]
```

Unbounded webhook fields are capped because they dominate context window,
reviewer attention, and the kernel `execve` string limit (one argv element or
one `NAME=value` entry cannot exceed 128 KiB). Templates without the filter
are unchanged. Operator-facing grammar also lives in
[Webhook Triggers](../webhook-triggers.md#prompt-placeholders).

## Agent launch payload (container environment)

Custom agent images and private runners must not assume the rendered prompt
arrives as one environment variable. Linux caps a single `execve` string
(one argv element or one `NAME=value` entry) at `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` (131072
bytes). The control plane delivers large text as base64 chunks and
reassembles files inside the container:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PRELOOP_AGENT_PROMPT_0..N` | Base64 chunks of the rendered prompt (96 KiB each). |
| `PRELOOP_AGENT_PROMPT_CHUNKS` | Chunk count (`0` when the prompt is empty). |
| `PRELOOP_AGENT_PROMPT_BYTES` | Decoded byte length, used to abort a truncated reassembly. |
| `AGENT_PROMPT_FILE` | Path the chunks materialize at (`/tmp/preloop/prompt.txt`). |
| `AGENT_PROMPT` | Whole prompt, **only when it is <= 64 KiB**. Absent above that. |
| `PRELOOP_INNER_SCRIPT_0..N` | Base64 chunks of the Kubernetes inner agent script. |
| `PRELOOP_INNER_SCRIPT_CHUNKS` / `PRELOOP_INNER_SCRIPT_BYTES` | Count and decoded size for that script. |
| `PRELOOP_INNER_SCRIPT` | Legacy whole-script value. Still honoured by the artifact wrapper so an old control plane can drive a new image. |

A new control plane can drive an old image: small prompts still set
`AGENT_PROMPT`, and the wrapper still accepts a whole `PRELOOP_INNER_SCRIPT`.
An old control plane can drive a new image the same way. Custom images that
read the prompt themselves should prefer `AGENT_PROMPT_FILE` after the
launch script's materialization block, or reassemble `PRELOOP_AGENT_PROMPT_*`
the same way (`base64 -d`, then `wc -c` against `_BYTES`). Do not require
`AGENT_PROMPT` for prompts above 64 KiB.

OpenHands (the default `agent_type`) uses this prompt transport on Docker
and Kubernetes. Gemini and OpenCode feed the materialized file to the CLI
on stdin, so the prompt is not an argv element (issue #692). Residuals
that still expand the file into argv are aider
(`--message "$(cat ...)"`), OpenHands (`-t "$(cat ...)"`), and Codex
nudge/recovery (`"$(cat ...)"` as a positional). Those are not part of
this contract.

## Model stream recovery

Hosted Docker/Kubernetes agent scripts and supported private Docker launches keep provider retries separate from session recovery. Codex uses four request retries and five stream retries (explicit for the gateway provider, matching its native defaults); OpenCode 1.18.29 already retries a model request up to five times; Gemini enables transport retries with four total chat-model attempts. After a transient CLI failure, the container can resume the captured parent conversation twice, with two- and four-second backoffs and a 600-second timeout per resume (forced termination after another five seconds). The execution's overall timeout still applies. These retry layers can multiply upstream attempts; they are bounded and do not guarantee recovery from a sustained outage.

Recovery requires an explicit captured session identifier. It does not start another conversation if capture fails, and it skips cancellation, terminal authorization/quota failures, and a terminal completion report written during this invocation. A content/stat fingerprint captured before the CLI starts preserves old result.json evidence from restored workspaces without mistaking it for completion of the new turn. The continuation prompt preserves conversation/tool results and asks the agent to inspect uncertain external actions before writing again. Initialization and the container's publication block execute once; model-controlled effects are not guaranteed exactly once. `PRELOOP_STREAM_RECOVERY`, `PRELOOP_STREAM_RECOVERY_RESULT`, and `PRELOOP_STREAM_RECOVERY_UNAVAILABLE` remain visible in agent logs. OpenCode/Gemini terminal JSON errors override a misleading zero CLI exit; truncated output without a terminal completion cannot count as success.

The separate private native-host execution profile supports only Cursor and retains its existing no-resume contract; OpenCode, Codex, and Gemini are not accepted on that path. Gemini is not currently a supported private Docker runner harness.

## PR-comment resume

`create_pull_request` (and GitLab merge-request creation) records the opened HTML URL and source branch on `flow_execution.result` (`flow_pr_binding`). When a flow listens to both issue events (`issue_labeled` or `issue_opened`) and `comment_created`, a later human comment on that PR starts a new execution of the same flow with `_resume` in the trigger payload. The container clones and pushes the existing PR branch. Unmatched comments do not start a run. Native CLI `--resume` is a separate follow-up.

**Wrapper-opened PRs bind too.** Not every PR comes from the MCP tool: when `git_clone_config.create_pull_request` is set, the container's post-execution step opens the PR itself with a plain `curl`. Title and body are JSON-encoded in the container (`json.dumps`) so quotes and newlines in a commit message or a multi-line `pull_request_description` cannot produce a 400. The wrapper prefers `pr_title` / `pr_body` from `/workspace/result.json`, then interpolated git-config fields, then a flow-attribution fallback: an execution link plus the last commit body, or `[Preloop] {flow_name}` with a `**Commits:**` list when more than one commit landed. The create response is written to `/workspace/evidence/pr.json`, with a lookup by head branch (GitHub) or source branch (GitLab) when the PR already existed, and one log line `PRELOOP_PR_OPENED {"url": ..., "branch": ..., "provider": ...}`. The orchestrator reads that line off the log stream (rescanning the output summary if a stream reconnect lost it) and records the URL and branch on the execution result at terminal status, next to the MCP-recorded binding.

**Implement, review, resume.** The PR reviewer flow posts as the Preloop bot, and bot-sent events are dropped by the loop guard, so its findings never reached the implementer. A `comment_created` event from a known Preloop identity is now allowed through that guard only when the body carries the reviewer marker `<!-- preloop-review:flow-id:<id>[:severity:<S>] -->`; every other bot comment stays dropped. Three guards bound the resulting loop:

*   **Self-loop:** a comment whose marker flow id names the receiving flow (its UUID or its name slug) never resumes it, so a flow cannot restart itself on its own output.
*   **Cap:** `max_resumes_per_pr` (flow-level, `agent_config.max_resumes_per_pr`, default 5) limits how many resumes one PR can start. The running count lives on the opening execution's result (`resume_count`) and each resume carries its `resume_index`; comments past the cap are logged and skipped.
*   **Queue one:** a correlated comment that arrives while a run for the same PR is still going does not start a competing execution. It sets `pending_followup` (with `pending_followup_comment_url`) on that running execution; further comments during the same run are coalesced onto the same flag. When the run reaches a terminal status (succeeded or failed), the orchestrator clears the flag and starts exactly one follow-up resume for the PR.

## CI-failure resume

Failing GitHub `check_run`, `check_suite`, and `workflow_run` events on a PR this flow opened resume the same way as a review comment, with `{{execution.ci_failure}}` filled in. The skip/resume filter is GitHub-only: existing GitLab `pipeline` / `job` flows keep firing on every event. GitLab payload extractors stay in `flow_ci_feedback` so an opt-in can reuse them later.

## Matrix / Batch Fan-Out

One flow definition can drive an agent-harness × model evaluation grid without cloning the flow per combination:

*   **Trigger:** `POST /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/trigger` reserves the top-level `matrix` key in the trigger body. When present, it must be a list of up to 25 `{"agent_type"?, "ai_model_id"?}` cells; the trigger fans out to one execution per cell (an empty object `{}` runs the flow defaults). Validation is all-or-nothing (allowed keys, agent types from the agent factory registry, account-visible models), and all execution rows are committed before any cell is dispatched. **Note for existing users:** `matrix` is now a reserved key in trigger bodies — it is stripped before template-variable resolution and never reaches `{{trigger_event...}}` placeholders; rename any pre-existing `matrix` field in custom trigger payloads.
*   **Batch identity:** all cells share a `batch_id` (indexed column on `flow_execution`). Per-cell overrides are persisted on each execution under the reserved `_matrix` key of `trigger_event_details`, making every cell self-describing. All paths that (re)build an agent executor — initial run, resume, background monitor, crash recovery — resolve the effective agent type through `resolve_execution_agent_selection` (matrix cell, then routing record, then flow default), so an interrupted cell is always handled by its own harness rather than the flow default.
*   **Observation:** `GET /api/v1/flows/batches/{batch_id}/executions` lists a batch (account-scoped, sorted by matrix index) with a rollup of status counts, tokens, tool calls, and estimated cost, so an eval matrix can be observed as a unit.
*   **Response shape:** non-matrix triggers are wire-identical to before; matrix triggers return `batch_id` plus per-cell execution references.

## Execution lineage

Executions expose `parent_execution_id`, `root_execution_id`, and
`delegation_depth` in detail and lightweight list responses. Existing and root
runs have null parent/root IDs and depth 0. Later delegation writers supply these
values at creation; this storage contract does not start child runs.

The parent is an indexed self-reference with `ON DELETE SET NULL`, so removing a
parent preserves its children. The indexed root ID has no foreign key and remains
a grouping label after root deletion; recorded depth is also preserved. A whole
tree consists of the root row plus executions whose root ID points to it.
`CRUDFlowExecution.get_children` requires an account, returns direct children
only, and orders them by start time then execution ID. The list query loads the
lineage fields and existing parking timestamps with the row so serializing a
page adds no per-row reads.

## Label-based model routing

A flow can optionally store ordered routing rules in `agent_config.model_routing` (no extra column). Each rule has a stable id, `labels.any` and/or `labels.all` against the issue's current labels, and an account-owned `ai_model_id` plus compatible `agent_type`. The first matching rule selects the model and harness for that execution. If none match, or the key is absent, the flow's selected model and harness are used. Examples in docs use operator-defined labels such as `documentation` or `bug`; there is no built-in taxonomy.

The controller writes the chosen rule or default onto the execution under reserved `_model_routing` after validating ownership and `_model_usable_for_agent`. Webhook bodies, tracker payloads, and authenticated trigger JSON cannot supply `ai_model_id`, `_matrix`, `_model_routing`, or `_resume` as authorized overrides. Retries pin from the persisted source execution (`retry_of_execution_id`); native continuation pins from a controller-loaded prior execution after account and lineage checks. A live rule or default change does not swap the model mid-conversation. Every new execution records its selected defaults, including flows without rules. Durable feedback copies this identity before reserving a repair turn. A missing legacy identity or changed native selection blocks continuation and requires an explicit new execution; no automatic model handoff occurs. New matrix cells also materialize their effective defaults. Authorized `matrix` eval cells still win over routing. Account budgets still apply. Operator guide: [model routing](../guide/flows/model-routing.md).

**Eval / observe runs (structured result artifact).** The `Observe / Eval` preset (`backend/presets/003-observe-eval.yaml`) establishes a run → capture → serve contract: the agent writes its final report to `/workspace/result.json` (`preloop.eval.result/v1`: `status`, `summary`, `metrics`, `checks`, optional `artifacts`), the orchestrator captures it first-class on every terminal path (success, failure, stop, timeout) via the Docker archive API — no log scraping or sentinels — and persists it to `flow_execution.result` (JSONB, size-capped; malformed or unfetchable artifacts are recorded as wrapped `{"error": ...}` objects so failures stay visible). It is served on `GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{id}` and `GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{id}/result` (404 when the run reported nothing); list payloads exclude it. The artifact is also an active success-confirmation channel alongside `FLOW_EXECUTION_SUCCESS`: `success` confirms the flow; `error`, `failed`, and `failure` fail it; and eval `fail` remains a subject verdict rather than a flow failure. Preloop transports and meters the artifact; scoring is owned by the customer's own verifier. On the Kubernetes backend a completed pod's filesystem is unreachable through the API, so the agent script is wrapped to emit `result.json` (and the evidence pack, see below) into the pod's log stream as base64 between structured `PRELOOP_ARTIFACT_*` marker lines; the runner parses the emission back out of the pod log with the same validation and error surfaces as the Docker archive path, and the marker lines are filtered out of operator-facing logs and summaries.

**Completion-confirmation recovery ladder.** An exit-0 run must confirm success through one of the two channels above (the exact-line `FLOW_EXECUTION_SUCCESS` sentinel, or a recognized `result.json` status/verdict); that requirement is unchanged for generic flows. When neither channel fired, the agent script has usually already reminded itself in place (see below) and the orchestrator walks a recovery ladder before failing closed: (1) post-exit log rescan: it refetches the complete runtime logs (`docker logs` / K8s pod logs, no tail limit) and rescans for the sentinel, armed at the `PRELOOP_AGENT_EXEC_START` marker, covering the edge where a late stream reconnect loses the log tail (logged as the `post_exit_log_rescan` milestone); (2) confirmation nudge: it re-invokes the agent once, at most one round per execution across retry attempts, with a minimal follow-up prompt (head of the original prompt plus a quoted output tail) asking it to confirm via the originally instructed channel or state failure plainly (logged as the `confirmation_nudge_used` milestone with its outcome). The nudge is side-effect free (`git_clone_config` and `custom_commands` are stripped) and only runs on runtimes that opt in via `AgentExecutor.supports_confirmation_nudge` (currently codex and opencode); all other runtimes skip straight to fail-closed. Two settings bound the round: `FLOW_CONFIRMATION_NUDGE_MAX_TOKENS` (default 4096) is a hard output-token ceiling (a larger limit inherited from the flow's model is clamped down; a tighter one is respected) and also bounds the embedded prior-context excerpt at ~4 chars/token, and `FLOW_CONFIRMATION_NUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300) bounds its wall clock. If the ladder ends without confirmation, or the nudge states failure, the execution is marked FAILED with the existing missing-confirmation message, which says so explicitly when the agent was already reminded in its own container.

**In-place completion nudge (the cheap rung).** `no_confirmation` was the largest single failure class on staging (33 of 100 failed executions, median duration 0.8 minutes): runs that exited 0 and simply never used a completion channel. The cheapest sound way to get the confirmation is to ask the agent that is still standing there, so the generated agent script now checks the completion contract itself and, when nothing confirmed it, re-invokes the SAME harness on the SAME session in the SAME container and workspace (`opencode run --continue`, `codex exec resume --last`) with a short reminder: do not redo or extend the task, do not take new side effects, write `/workspace/result.json` and print the sentinel for success, or report the failure plainly, then stop. The reminder's output is judged by exactly the same contract, because it lands on the same stdout and writes the same result artifact. Safety comes from placement rather than policy: the block is emitted *before* the container's post-execution git block and runs only when the harness exited 0, so a nudge can never re-run a push or a PR creation; it runs at most once; and its exit code is discarded, so a failed reminder leaves the run exactly where it was. Three marker lines make the round observable (`PRELOOP_COMPLETION_NUDGE`, `PRELOOP_COMPLETION_NUDGE_RESULT exit=<n>`, `PRELOOP_COMPLETION_NUDGE_UNSUPPORTED <runtime>`); the orchestrator reads them from the live stream and again from the post-exit log refetch, publishes them as the `completion_nudge` and `completion_nudge_result` timeline events, and then stands down from its own second-session nudge (`skipped_inplace_nudge_used`), which would be a second model call for the same answer from a session that knows strictly less. It also stands down when any action is already on the timeline (`skipped_actions_recorded`): a re-invoked model that decides to finish the job would repeat that posted comment. Runtimes that opt in declare `AgentExecutor.supports_inplace_completion_nudge` (currently codex and opencode). Settings: `FLOW_COMPLETION_NUDGE_ENABLED` (default true, `flowExecution.completionNudge.enabled`) is the fleet-wide kill switch, `FLOW_COMPLETION_NUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300, floor 30) bounds the round.

**Wider completion signals for runtimes that cannot be resumed.** Gemini, Aider, OpenHands and remote runners have no resume mechanism, so there is nobody left to ask. For those (and only those: the check is a strict identity test against `supports_inplace_completion_nudge is False`, so an unknown capability keeps failing closed) a non-empty `result.json` that the agent actually wrote is accepted as the completion signal even when its vocabulary is not one Preloop recognizes, logged as the `completion_signal_accepted` milestone with `signal: result_artifact_present`. An explicit failure status is decided earlier and still fails the run, and a runtime that *was* asked directly and declined to confirm never reaches this rung.

**No-progress guard (a run that never edits anything).** Some implementation runs read, plan, summarize and end with an empty workspace, having spent the full budget on nothing. Two rungs catch that, both driven by one piece of evidence: the workspace itself. (1) Live, on the poll loop: when `agent_config.no_progress_after_seconds` is set and that many seconds have passed with the checkout provably clean (`git status --porcelain` empty and no local commit ahead of the remote, probed in the running container at most once a minute), the orchestrator delivers ONE short reminder into the session that is still running, through the same resume mechanism the in-place completion nudge uses (`codex exec resume --last`, started detached so the loop is not blocked), logged as the `no_progress_nudge` milestone and published as a timeline event. After a further `no_progress_grace_seconds` (default 600) still clean, the run is stopped and classified `agent_no_progress` (`no_progress_stop`). A probe that cannot answer (Kubernetes, an unreadable checkout) returns "no answer" and never "clean": a stop always rests on a probe that actually ran, and a run that has any diff is never nudged and never stopped by this guard. Runtimes without an in-place resume get the stop without the reminder. The key is null by default, which disables both rungs. (2) Terminal: when the agent itself reports failure through `result.json` and the container's post-execution git block found no commit to push (`PRELOOP_NO_COMMITS <branch>`), the failure is classified `agent_no_progress` rather than the generic agent error, so "tried and could not" is separable from "never started". `agent_config.retry_on_no_progress` (`{"enabled": true, "ai_model_id": ..., "reasoning_effort": ...}`, off by default) then creates exactly one retry through the normal manual-retry path with `retry_of_execution_id` set, optionally escalating to a stronger model; a retry is never itself retried.

**Per-flow timeout budget.** `flow.timeout_seconds` (nullable, 60..86400, on the create/update API and settable from a preset YAML) is the wall-clock budget for one execution of that flow; NULL keeps the deployment default `FLOW_EXECUTION_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS` (3600, `flowExecution.maxWaitSeconds`). The orchestrator resolves and clamps it once per run, records it on the `agent_monitoring_started` milestone (`timeout_seconds`, `timeout_source`), enforces it in the monitor loop, and on expiry writes `agent_execution_timeout` and a message that names the budget that ran out ("this flow's timeout budget" vs "the default timeout budget"), still classified `timeout`. This is what separates "genuinely long" from "stuck": with one global ceiling, all 7 staging timeouts sat on exactly 3600 seconds and said nothing about which was which. A PR review that should finish in minutes (`002-pull-request-reviewer.yaml`, 1800) and a release audit that legitimately runs for hours (`006-release-security-audit.yaml`, 7200) now carry their own budgets.

**Hosted-monitor concurrency.** Each flow-execution worker process may babysit `FLOW_EXECUTION_MAX_INFLIGHT` hosted monitors at once (default 10, `flowExecution.maxInflight`). The cap is a process-wide semaphore shared by `execute_flow` and `resume_flow_execution`. Other worker pools stay serial: they were not sized for fan-out. Helm injects a dedicated `flowExecution.databasePool` (size 10 / overflow 4) on the flow-execution pool so those short-lived sessions are not squeezed through the generic worker 2+4 pool.

**Per-account admission cap.** Admission is also bounded per account, so one account cannot fill every worker. `FLOW_EXECUTION_MAX_RUNNING_PER_ACCOUNT` (default 5, Helm `flowExecution.maxRunningPerAccount`) is enforced inside `claim_execution`. The cap bounds hosted compute only: an execution assigned to one of the account's private runners is bounded by that runner's own capacity, so it is neither counted nor held back. An account may override the cap through `account.meta_data["flow_execution_max_running_per_account"]`. A refused execution stays `PENDING` with `queued_reason=account_concurrency_cap` and its message is nacked for later redelivery. Independently, a flow gets at most one active execution per tracker object (issue, pull request, or merge request): a later matching trigger is recorded as skipped rather than queued. Comment and CI deliveries are exempt so they can still feed a live run. A `labels` condition on a labeled/unlabeled delivery tests the label the event carries, not the issue's full label list.

**Stale-claim reaper.** Every `FLOW_EXECUTION_RECLAIM_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 30, Helm `flowExecution.reclaimIntervalSeconds`) the reaper re-publishes active executions that are unclaimed or whose claim heartbeat went stale. That is the deploy-handoff safety net: an execution whose owning worker died is adopted by another worker inside one stale window. Three bounds keep it from becoming a storm, because "nobody has claimed this" and "nobody has a free slot for this" look identical from the database. (1) The pass runs under a session-level advisory lock (`pg_try_advisory_lock`) pinned to one connection for the whole pass, so one replica reaps per interval instead of all of them; losing the lease is not an error, the loser skips the pass and Postgres releases the lock if the holder's connection dies. (2) Each execution carries `redispatch_count` and `last_redispatch_at`: the gap between two re-dispatches of the same execution doubles from the reclaim interval up to `FLOW_EXECUTION_REDISPATCH_BACKOFF_MAX_SECONDS` (default 900, Helm `flowExecution.redispatchBackoffMaxSeconds`), so an hour of being unclaimed costs a handful of publishes rather than 120. A successful claim resets both, so a run that queued for an hour and then lost its owner is still recovered at once. (3) Before publishing, the worker asks JetStream whether flow tasks are already queued undelivered; when they are, executions that still need a container are left queued rather than republished into a queue nobody can drain. Executions that already have an agent session bypass the capacity and per-account filters, because an unmonitored container is worse than being one over a limit. Each pass logs exactly one line: `candidates`, `re-dispatched`, `skipped_backoff`, `skipped_account_cap`, `skipped_no_capacity`, `failed`.

**Terminal notifications (`flow.notifications`).** A flow can opt into posting a tracker comment when an execution ends, instead of asking the agent to ping the triggering issue from the prompt. `on_success.comment_on_trigger_issue` posts a short "PR opened: \<url\>" comment when the run recorded a `pr_url`. The orchestrator posts it from the terminal path (including resume), and a notification failure never rewrites the execution status. The console offers the option only where it can apply: the flow opens the pull request itself (`git_clone_config.create_pull_request`) and the trigger is about an issue (a tracker trigger with an `issue_*` or `comment_*` event).

Failed executions always appear as console attention items of kind `flow`, and there is no failure comment: `on_failure.comment_on_trigger_issue` (removed 2026-09) and `on_failure.attention_item` are parsed and ignored so flows stored before the removal still load. `notifications` is a JSONB column, so nothing is migrated; a save from the console writes the blob back without the `on_failure` block.

**Evidence packs.** Audit-style flows (`backend/presets/004`–`007`) write a
human-readable evidence pack under `/workspace/evidence/`. Two transports
move that pack to the control plane. Direct upload
(`FLOW_ARTIFACT_DIRECT_UPLOAD`) gives hosted containers and private Docker
runners an execution-scoped PUT to the encrypted artifact store
(`kind=evidence`). Kubernetes logs then carry status markers only, including
when the upload fails: there is no plaintext fallback. The legacy transport
is the default. Docker copies the directory through the engine archive API
and does not use the log channel, so `FLOW_EVIDENCE_LOG_PLAINTEXT` does not
change Docker capture. Kubernetes, with the plaintext switch left at its
default `true`, emits a size-capped base64 block (`MAX_EVIDENCE_ARCHIVE_BYTES`,
2 MiB) of `result.json`, the evidence pack, and the workspace snapshot into
the pod log. That default is an exposure window: base64 is not encryption,
and anyone who can read retained pod logs can read the artifacts. Set
`FLOW_EVIDENCE_LOG_PLAINTEXT=false` to refuse that channel. Without an
upload token the wrapper fails closed (markers `unavailable` /
`skipped` with reason `plaintext_disabled`, no artifact bytes). The receipt
is `failed` with error `plaintext_disabled`, which means unavailable by
policy, and result capture reports a missing result rather than a decoded
payload. The switch does not cover pod-spec access or ordinary agent
stdout. Encrypted log transport with per-execution keys is a separate
decision tracked in issue #268. `GET .../result` and `GET .../evidence-status`
report the persisted receipt (`kind=evidence`) without decrypt; download
verifies digest and tenancy and reports `available` / `missing` / `expired`
/ `failed` distinctly. Packs are signed at capture with the account Ed25519
key; the signature lives beside the archive so the content-addressed digest
does not change. See
[evidence-storage.md](../guide/flows/evidence-storage.md). This is operational
retention, not object-lock.

**Workspace persistence (snapshot, restore, retention).** An execution that fails after the agent committed used to lose the work: on Docker the named volume `agent-workspace-<execution_id>` survived by accident with no way to find it, and on Kubernetes the `emptyDir` died with the pod. Every hosted run now captures a size-capped `tar.gz` of `/workspace` on every terminal path, success or failure, next to the evidence pack. `.git` is kept whole (the unpushed commits are the point) and a `git bundle --all` of every repository is written into it first as an independent second copy of the commit graph; regenerable caches (`node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and friends) are excluded. The cap is `WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT_MAX_BYTES` (default 512 MiB) and it is enforced *inside* the container: the tar stream is piped through `head -c`, so an oversized workspace never writes more than the cap to disk, never crosses the runtime boundary, and is skipped with a logged `PRELOOP_WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT_SKIPPED size_exceeds_limit` reason. Docker builds the archive in a short-lived helper container mounted on the workspace volume (the agent container has already exited and cannot run `tar`); Kubernetes emits it through the same `PRELOOP_ARTIFACT_*` log channel as the evidence pack, which caps it at 2 MiB there, so larger Kubernetes workspaces are reported as skipped until snapshots move to object storage. The archive is stored on `flow_execution.workspace_snapshot` (BYTEA, excluded from the execution schemas) and served by `GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{id}/workspace`. A correlated resume (a PR comment on a PR this flow opened) loads the prior execution's snapshot, unpacks it into the new Docker workspace before the entrypoint runs, and the init script then skips the clone and does `fetch` + `checkout` + `merge --ff-only` of the PR branch inside the restored repository, so unpushed commits are continued rather than redone. The decision is made in the container (`[ -d <repo>/.git ]`), so a restore that did not land silently falls back to the normal clone; Kubernetes always falls back, because an `emptyDir` cannot be seeded before start. Retention is a decision rather than a leak: an hourly janitor task (`cleanup_flow_workspaces`) clears snapshots and removes `agent-workspace-*` Docker volumes older than `WORKSPACE_SNAPSHOT_TTL_HOURS` (default 24; 0 means delete on the next pass). Private runners keep their workspaces on the operator's own machine and never upload them.

**Codebase setup (`git_clone_config.setup_commands`).** An implementation agent that cannot run the real test suite is guessing, and "the DB-backed tests need a Postgres this container does not have" is not an agent failure. `setup_commands` is a list of shell strings run inside the container after the clone or workspace restore and before the agent starts, from the first repository's clone path. All output is captured to `/workspace/evidence/setup.log` (inside the evidence pack, so it is retrievable even when the workspace snapshot was too large to keep); the first failing command stops the block, prints `PRELOOP_SETUP_FAILED exit=<n>` plus the log tail, and fails the execution with the dedicated `setup_failed` failure category, so a broken environment never reads as a broken agent.

```yaml
git_clone_config:
  enabled: true
  setup_commands:
    - pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    - docker run -d --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=preloop -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
    - until pg_isready -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres; do sleep 1; done
    - echo 'DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://postgres:preloop@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres' > /workspace/.env
```

Setup commands run in a subshell (`set -e; cd <clone path>`), so `export`, `cd`, and other shell state do not reach the agent process. Persist anything the agent needs in a file (as above) rather than relying on the environment.

Services are the caveat. A `docker run` inside a setup command needs a runner that is allowed to touch a Docker socket: on a private runner that means the trust flags the operator opts into explicitly, and on the hosted runners it needs a per-execution service sidecar, which is the next phase of this work (a declarative `services:` block with a Docker network on the Docker runner and pod sidecars on Kubernetes). Until then, keep setup commands to what a plain container can do: install dependencies, build, seed fixtures, start in-process services.

**Publication gate (`git_clone_config.verification`).** A prompt that asks an implementation agent to run tests is a request, not a contract: the agent's `result.json` is a claim about what it did, and the publisher has no way to tell a tested change from an asserted one. The gate turns verification into something the runner owns. A flow opts in by setting `verification.mode: "gate"` with a **trusted test profile**: a versioned (`v1`) mapping of changed-file patterns to required checks (`always` inexpensive hooks required on every diff, `rules` matched against the diff against the PR base, and an `unknown_default` applied to every unmatched changed path so a mixed documentation/code diff cannot hide unknown impact). The profile ships with the flow configuration, never inside the target repository, so the agent cannot narrow required checks or edit the profile to bypass the gate within its own PR. It may *propose* additional checks through `proposed_checks` in its result artifact; only the profile decides what is required.

After the agent exits and commits, before the push and before pull-request creation, the post-execution block runs a runner-controlled verifier inside the container: it derives the changed files from the merge base, selects the required checks with the same selection implementation the runner-side contract uses (`preloop.utils.verification_selection`, embedded verbatim into the verifier script so the two can never drift), executes each check with `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`, a per-command timeout, and the `PRELOOP_VERIFY_BASE`/`PRELOOP_VERIFY_HEAD` range contract, and records evidence: commands, exit codes, per-check logs, an environment digest, the profile version, and the exact commit SHA and tree hash it verified. The legacy verifier always runs required checks: files in the agent sandbox cannot safely certify a cached pass. Reuse requires an authenticated runner/controller cache bound to the commit, tree, complete profile and environment. Selection reasons are recorded with the evidence, so operators can read *why* each check was required.

The verdict is fail-closed. Publication (push and PR creation) runs only when every required check passed on the exact commit and tree being published and the tracked tree is clean; a failed check denies publication as `verification_failed`, a check that could not run (missing interpreter, exhausted gate budget) as `verification_blocked`, and anything uncertain — no verdict file, a crash, a commit that appeared after the gate — denies too. A denial exits non-zero, which fails the execution with its commits and evidence kept recoverable; nothing unverified leaves the workspace. There is no draft-publication exception in this mode. The orchestrator captures the compact evidence from the `PRELOOP_VERIFICATION` marker line and stores it under `verification` in the execution result (with `source: runner`), while an agent-authored `verification` key in `result.json` is demoted to `verification_reported` — the implemented status (`status`) and the verification status (`verification.status`) are two different, separately auditable fields. Evidence logs land in `/workspace/evidence/verification/` inside the normal evidence pack. The full credential boundary for test processes (no write credentials) is a separate workstream (issue #432).

Flows saved before the gate existed resolve to `mode: "off"` through `effective_verification_policy()` — an explicit, visible "ungated, because no policy is configured" rather than a silent default — while an explicitly configured malformed policy blocks publication; it never silently downgrades to off. The flow API also validates the profile shape on save.

## Transient Failure Handling

A flow run crosses two systems that fail independently and briefly: the Kubernetes API that creates the agent Job, and the model provider behind the gateway. Neither should end a run on its own. Three bounded, jittered retry layers cover them, and every terminal failure is stamped with a category so the remaining failures can be counted instead of read.

**Layer 1 — agent Job creation (`ContainerAgentExecutor`).** The Job name is derived from the execution id, so a *second* session for the same execution collides with the first. That is exactly what the run-level retry (layer 3) and the confirmation nudge do, and on staging it turned a recoverable provider blip into `Failed to start agent Job: (409) Conflict` — 8 of 100 failed executions. Two changes: each additional session now asks for its own name (`agent-<execution-id>-a2`, `…-nudge`; the first attempt keeps the historic unsuffixed name so in-flight runs stay addressable), and Job creation is wrapped in a bounded retry. On a `409 AlreadyExists` the existing Job is *read* rather than blindly recreated: if it belongs to this execution and is still live it is adopted (an idempotent create, e.g. a duplicate dispatch, must not fail the run); if it belongs to this execution and has finished it is deleted with `propagationPolicy=Background`, waited for, and recreated, but only while a creation attempt remains, because deleting a leftover nothing will recreate would cost its logs and fail the run anyway; if it belongs to a *different* execution, or carries no `preloop.execution_id` label to prove it is ours, the run fails immediately as `runner_conflict` rather than adopting or deleting someone else's agent. `429`/`5xx` from the API server are retried. Bounds: `AGENT_JOB_CREATE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3, `flowExecution.agentJobCreate.maxAttempts`) and `AGENT_JOB_CREATE_RETRY_BASE_SECONDS` (default 0.5, exponential with equal jitter). Set max attempts to 1 to disable the layer: a 409 then fails the run as `runner_conflict` without touching the conflicting Job.

**Layer 2 — upstream model calls (model gateway).** Inside one client request, the gateway retries an upstream failure that happened *before any token was forwarded to the client* — connection errors, `429`, `5xx`, and a stream that dies during prefetch. A partially streamed response is never retried, because the client has already seen output. `Retry-After` is honoured and capped so a hostile header cannot pin a worker. Bounds: `MODEL_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3), `MODEL_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_RETRY_BASE_SECONDS` (default 0.2), `MODEL_GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_RETRY_AFTER_CAP_SECONDS` (default 8), under `environment.modelGatewayUpstreamRetry` in Helm. The number of retries spent on a request is recorded on the usage row (`meta_data.upstream_retries`) and published to the execution timeline as `retried: n` on the `model_gateway_call` event, so a slow run that was quietly rescued is visible rather than mysterious.

**Layer 3 — whole-attempt retry (`_run_agent_with_retries`).** When the agent process itself dies, the run is retried from scratch only where that is provably safe; otherwise it fails with a category. The safety boundary is the container's post-execution block (git push, PR/MR creation), which the entrypoints run only on exit 0. So an attempt is retried only when *all* of: the agent exited non-zero (no push/PR happened), no actions were recorded on the timeline, and the failure was classified transient by the executor's analysis of the full logs. An unknown exit code counts as unsafe. Bounds: `FLOW_EXECUTION_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 2) and `FLOW_EXECUTION_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS` (default 15, doubling). Retries are never silent: each one writes an `execution_retry_scheduled` milestone, a timeline warning, and an `execution_retry` update; exhaustion writes `execution_retries_exhausted`.

**Failure categories.** Every terminal non-success execution stores a coarse `failure_category` (`flow_execution.failure_category`, indexed; exposed on the execution list and detail schemas) from a closed vocabulary: `runner_conflict`, `runner_error`, `model_transient`, `model_auth`, `provider_billing`, `budget_exceeded`, `model_quota`, `model_config`, `no_confirmation`, `agent_no_progress`, `setup_failed`, `verification_failed`, `verification_blocked`, `tool_error`, `agent_error`, `timeout`, `cancelled`, `unknown`. It is derived once at failure time by `preloop.services.flow_failure_category.derive_failure_category` from the best evidence available, in order: a category named by the raising code (e.g. `AgentStartError`), structural message shapes that identify the failing layer regardless of provider noise (runner conflict, runner error, timeout, cancellation, missing completion confirmation, publication-gate denial), then the agent executor's failure analysis of the full logs (which shares the `upstream_errors` taxonomy with the gateway), then provider-message patterns. Anything unmatched is `unknown` rather than being folded into `agent_error` — a rising `unknown` share is the signal to extend the module. `error_message` remains the human-readable detail; the category is what you group by. Existing rows are not backfilled: categories are derived from live failure context, and guessing them from historical prose would launder a heuristic into stored data.


The legacy verifier runs in the same sandbox as the agent. Its producer label,
files and log markers are diagnostic data, not an authenticated attestation.
Agents or repository commands can reproduce a marker. Credential-isolated
publication must use a separate controller/runner-host verifier that observes
command completion outside that sandbox on an immutable commit artifact. Never
promote `PRELOOP_VERIFICATION` JSON directly to trusted publication authorization.

### Isolated publication (integration preview)

`git_clone_config.publication_mode` defaults to `legacy` for saved-flow
compatibility. Legacy mode executes publication in the agent container and
shares tracker write credentials with that runtime; it is not a credential
isolation boundary. Operators must explicitly migrate a flow to `isolated`.
Hosted execution has a controller-owned verification adapter. Private runner
publication additionally requires the authenticated runner-host protocol. An
isolated execution without controller-issued evidence fails closed before
issuing write access.

Isolated flows require `verification.mode: gate`, a nonempty trusted profile,
and `verification.image` set to a digest-pinned generic toolchain image. That
image must provide Python 3, Git, a shell, and the dependencies needed by its
configured checks. Verification does not reuse the agent's virtual environment,
node_modules, writable caches, or workspace. A check may perform bounded setup
using dependencies already available in the image, including local package
caches and service binaries; it cannot download dependencies during verification.
This is a generic toolchain contract, not a requirement to bake an application
or its database into the harness image. Missing dependencies fail the check and
leave the captured work recoverable.

The controller resolves the exact base commit before starting the agent. After
committing recovery artifacts to durable storage it deletes the owned agent
runtime and confirms its absence, including residual Kubernetes pods. A missing
or failed recovery capture retains the original runtime and blocks publication. It derives changed paths from
the frozen bundle, selects relevant checks from the trusted profile, and runs
each check in a fresh credential-free checkout of the same head. Docker has no
network, host mounts, or host namespaces. Kubernetes disables service-account
automount and applies a deny-all NetworkPolicy. Because policies are additive,
existing permissive policies matching the verifier's labels block startup.
Hosted clusters must enforce NetworkPolicy and prevent concurrent policy or
admission changes from weakening the verifier namespace's isolation. The controller observes process exit codes and confirms every
verifier runtime was removed before minting writer credentials. Check diagnostics
retain a bounded scrubbed output tail, per-check elapsed time, and Docker log
rotation limits runtime log growth.
If Kubernetes deletion cannot be confirmed, the deny-all NetworkPolicy remains
with the execution's verifier label for operator recovery; removing it first
would restore network access to residual pods. Log markers and result files
never authorize publication.

The isolated path binds a single repository and its base/target branches from
account-owned flow/project records. It never accepts a webhook clone URL as
publication authority. GitHub App installation tokens are minted for exactly
that repository: `contents:read` for the agent, then `contents:write` and
`pull_requests:write` for the publisher after verification. Stored PATs and
GitLab publication are rejected in this mode until a broker can enforce their
scope and lifetime. The standalone metadata/provider client supports both
GitHub and GitLab. Private runners require an authenticated current capability
advertisement confirming protocol v1 and a locally available digest-pinned
trusted helper image. Older runners cannot receive an isolated lease. Private
source stays on the runner; the controller receives only bounded manifests,
check outcomes, and the provider receipt.

Private verification is an ordered, nonce-bound handshake. The runner removes
the agent and residual volume writers, freezes the bundle in independent
storage, runs the exact controller-selected checks, and confirms verifier
removal. Only then does the controller issue a repository-scoped writer to the
trusted publisher helper. Agent result files and ordinary completion messages
cannot advance publication. Both helper and controller revoke the writer;
already-invalid token responses make repeated revocation safe.

Recovered private monitoring restores the protected policy and accepted receipt
without relaunching the agent or replaying credentials. Queued isolated
executions fail closed on worker recovery because their original lease cannot
be safely replayed; retry explicitly after an eligible runner is available.
Private frozen recovery artifacts remain local with a fixed 24-hour retention
limit after verification or publication failure. A recovered hosted isolated
execution currently cannot reconstruct its original trusted policy
snapshot: it fails closed with an explicit diagnostic and retains its original
runtime for recovery. It does not silently switch to ungated publication.

After runtime cleanup, the control-plane publisher imports a bounded,
self-contained `branch.bundle` into a fresh bare object store. It never checks
out repository code, imports agent Git configuration, or runs repository hooks,
filters, credential helpers or shell commands. Each Git child has a clean
environment and CPU, memory (Linux), file-size and time limits. HTTPS redirects
are disabled. The publisher validates the exact verified head, checks the
expected remote SHA and ancestry, then uses an atomic lease to reject concurrent
remote changes. It never rewrites unexpected remote history. Provider failures
mark publication failed and retain captured recovery evidence; retry reuses the
existing branch and PR. Write tokens are revoked on success/failure and expire
at the provider-issued deadline if revocation is unavailable.

The controller handoff is `VerifiedPublication(execution_id, head_sha,
bundle_sha256)`. It is an internal type, not an agent JSON schema. A trusted
verifier adapter must construct it only after verifying the immutable artifact
in an environment the agent cannot modify. Agent-written result files or log
markers cannot establish this attestation. Hosted adapters construct it only
after the complete trusted verification lifecycle. Deploy the control plane
separately from agent workloads;
never mount its process namespace, filesystem, Docker socket or signing keys
into those workloads.

### PR descriptions and execution provenance

Repository setup selects `git_clone_config.pull_request_template` when set,
then the conventional GitHub/GitLab default, then the lexicographically first
named Markdown template. It writes `/workspace/evidence/pr-template.md` for the
agent to fill. No template uses Summary and Testing. Configured missing,
invalid, oversized or escaping template paths fail setup. Tests that did not
run remain unchecked. The implementation preset asks for problem, resulting
behavior, acceptance evidence, verified commands, limitations and an issue link.

`result.json` retains #420's `pr_title`/`pr_body` fields and aliases. Valid agent
text wins per field over configured text and commit text. Titles are one line,
at most 256 UTF-8 bytes; bodies are at most 60,000 UTF-8 bytes. Invalid/missing
metadata falls back with a diagnostic; no truncation silently changes meaning.
All publication sources receive execution attribution. The isolated publisher
owns only the `preloop:executions` HTML-comment region. It upserts trusted
initial/repair execution links and published SHAs while preserving human edits
outside that region, including metadata-only repairs. Links use `PRELOOP_URL`
and existing authorization-protected console routes; tokens and transcripts
are never provenance inputs. Legacy publication adds the current execution
block on creation. When an open pull request or merge request already exists
for the branch, legacy mode fetches that description, appends the current
execution id and head SHA to the owned block when that pair is not already
present, and updates only the body. Human prose and the title stay as they
were. A malformed owned region or an oversized rewrite warns through
`PRELOOP_PR_METADATA_WARNING` and leaves the owned provenance region unchanged;
the independent failure-disclosure refresh still runs. A failed provider update
is surfaced and never reported as successful publication.
Isolated GitLab publication stays unsupported until a broker can enforce
credential scope and lifetime.

Continuation append keeps the first execution record and the most recent 199 repair records (`PROVENANCE_RECENT_RECORDS`). The 201st continuation still lands (`test_append_provenance_keeps_the_first_record_and_recent_199`).

The standalone metadata client still accepts a GitLab payload shape. Isolated
mode does not: `validate_publication_tracker` rejects PAT and GitLab
credentials before a lease is minted.

Preset synchronization updates uncustomized fields and marks customized saved
flows as having an available update. Inspect the effective saved prompt and
configuration before expecting template behavior. The publication-mode switch
is deliberate and is not silently enabled by updating the prompt.
