# Security Considerations

Editions: OSS. Contributor documentation for this repository.

Auth, tenancy, redaction, and secret custody are platform concerns, not agent self-reporting. This chapter covers the security checklist, redaction policy, secret service, the tamper-evident audit chain and record signatures, security-screen scoring, and `preloop.security`.

## Security Screen Scoring (QM Proxy Contract)
*   **Purpose:** Let external agent platforms delegate content security screening to Preloop through a documented HTTP contract, starting with QM's `securityScreen: { backend: "proxy" }` deployment option.
*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/security-screen/score` (`api/endpoints/security_screen.py`) accepts `{text, hook, metadata}` with the caller's token in `x-api-key` (Bearer fallback) and returns `{score, threshold, primary_outcome}`; `primary_outcome` is omitted for benign content. Auth reuses the model gateway's `authenticate_bearer_token`, so a standard Preloop API key is the routed credential.
*   **Scoring:** `services/security_screen.py` is a pure, deterministic rule engine: compiled case-insensitive regex categories (`prompt_injection`, `destructive_command`, `destructive_sql`, `secret_exfiltration`) with max-match-wins scoring. No I/O, no model calls, no persistence on the scoring path; the threshold comes from `PRELOOP_SECURITY_SCREEN_THRESHOLD` (default 0.7, clamped).
*   **Privacy:** Screened text is never logged or stored. Flagged chunks log score, outcome, matched rule names, and caller chunk coordinates only.
*   **Rollout Semantics:** Shadow vs enforce and fail-closed error handling live on the caller's side (per QM's contract); Preloop only scores.

## Secret Service
*   **Purpose:** Provider-agnostic custody and resolution of model credentials.
*   **Built-in Backend:** `local_encrypted` for encrypted-at-rest credentials stored in Preloop-managed storage.
*   **External Backends:** Optional Vault/OpenBao-compatible KV v2 references via `SecretReference.external_ref`.
*   **Runtime Boundary:** Gateway-enabled runtimes receive Preloop gateway tokens instead of provider API keys.

## preloop.security (`./backend/preloop/security`)
*   **Purpose:** Deterministic, server-side validation of security audit results. It is result validation, not scanning.
*   **Gap-Register Freeze:** `gap_register.py` validates the `result.json` produced by release security audit runs. Previous SHA+path finding rows are a floor: dropping one without a `resolved` marker plus a reason fails, unclassified rows fail, and `secrets_findings_count` must match the row count. The agent never self-grades the floor.
*   **Git Guard:** `git_guard.py` allow-lists metadata-only git invocations so no historical blob contents can be dumped into logs or transcripts. It has no production callers yet; it is the enforcement half of the planned follow-up that wires `validate_gap_register` into result ingestion.
*   **Waiver Inputs:** `waivers.py` deterministically factors human-authored waiver entries (`{id, reason, author, date}`, plus optional scope/expiry/package/version and the platform approval id for interactively collected ones) into a severity-gate outcome: alias-aware matching (a CVE id waives the same advisory surfaced under a GHSA/OSV alias), verbatim echo of applied entries, unmatched/invalid entries surfaced rather than dropped, and an unwaived failure always keeps the gate failed. Interactive `006` waivers bind stored `ask_user` `tool_result`/`responses` (exact finding id and human reason), not `status=approved` or question text. Ambiguous `request_approval` prose, including a `waive_finding` operation, is not a waiver. AI-judged and auto-approved rows cannot authenticate a human waiver or due-diligence decision. The severity gate is KEV or CVSS >= 9.0 unless trigger/CI `gate.fail_on_kev` / `gate.fail_on_cvss_gte` (in `[0, 10]`) override it: never model-authored `gate.policy` display text. There is no per-product policy table.
*   **Scanner Boundary:** Scanners (gitleaks, zizmor) are installed and run inside the agent execution sandbox per the release security audit preset (`backend/presets/006-release-security-audit.yaml`), never on the platform control plane.

## Tamper-evident audit trail and signed records
*   **Chain:** A background pass seals audit rows per account into a hash chain (`chain_seq`, `prev_hash`, `row_hash`). Editing, deleting, or reordering a sealed row breaks every hash from that point. Sealing is off the request path so a chain error cannot fail the audited action. Signed checkpoints over the chain head are the artifact a customer can keep off the platform.
*   **Keys:** One active Ed25519 key per account. The private half is Fernet-encrypted with `SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_KEY`; the public half is published. Rotation retires the old key without invalidating signatures it already made.
*   **Signatures:** Detached, over a digest, with the payload type inside the signed bytes so a period-export signature cannot be replayed as an evidence-pack signature. Evidence packs are signed at capture, not at download. Signing is never a precondition: an unsigned export or pack is still served.
*   **Verification:** `preloop audit verify` and `preloop evidence verify` recompute hashes and signatures on the caller's machine and tell the caller to trust that walk over the server's verdict. Operator guide: [Evidence storage and signed records](../guide/flows/evidence-storage.md).
*   **What this does not prove:** A compromised server can forge a record before it is signed. The chain is not WORM. Rows below the retention purge floor and rows not yet sealed are outside any result.

## Authentication & Authorization

Preloop implements authentication and multi-tenancy:

**Authentication:**
- JWT-based authentication for REST API and MCP endpoints
- Token-based authentication with refresh token support
- Email verification for new user accounts
- Integration points for SSO and OAuth providers (future)
- Per-user `auth_generation` (JWT `gen` claim). `POST /auth/sessions/revoke-all`
  increments it; `get_current_user`, `POST /auth/refresh`, the CLI JWT
  branch of `POST /oauth/token`, and the WebSocket upgrade
  (`WebSocketAuthMiddleware`) reject a token whose `gen` is behind the
  user. Tokens minted before the claim existed are treated as generation 0,
  so one bump also invalidates them. API keys and runner tokens are
  unchanged. `preloop auth logout --all` and the console Sign out everywhere
  control call that endpoint.
- `POST /auth/logout` is the console's server-side sign out. It runs the
  registered H9 `SessionHook.on_logout` (from `preloop.plugins.account_hooks`)
  with the current token's claims and returns `redirect_url`: a same-origin
  path the console navigates to next, or null for the default.
  `run_logout_hook` drops any redirect that is not a same-origin path, and
  the console checks it again. With no hook registered it changes nothing
  server-side; the console clears its own tokens either way. Sign out
  everywhere skips this call because revoke-all already ended the session.
- `SessionHook.is_token_revoked` runs after the generation and CLI session
  checks in `reject_revoked_token`, so an extension can revoke a single JWT it
  issued. With no hook registered it is not called.
- Console refresh tokens (`POST /auth/refresh`) carry `sat` and are capped
  at `MAX_SESSION_DAYS` (default 30). CLI login refresh tokens stay
  long-lived (`CLI_JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`, default 365); revocation
  is the control for those, not the session cap.
- Each CLI login (`/oauth/token` without PKCE) records a `cli_session` row.
  Its access and refresh JWTs carry the row id as `sid`; the refresh token
  also carries a `jti` that must equal `cli_session.refresh_jti`. Rotation
  swaps the `jti` in one conditional UPDATE, so a refresh token that was
  already rotated away is rejected. Revoking the row (`POST /oauth/revoke`
  with either token, `DELETE /auth/sessions/cli/{id}`, `preloop auth logout`)
  rejects both tokens of that login in `get_current_user`, the WebSocket
  upgrade and the refresh path; other logins are unaffected.
  `POST /auth/refresh` does not accept a token with `sid`, so a CLI refresh
  token cannot be turned into console tokens that escape the row check.
  A CLI refresh token from before `sid` existed is moved onto a new row the
  next time it rotates; the old token itself stays covered by the
  generation check only.
- `POST /oauth/revoke` still revokes opaque MCP tokens. A JWT without `sid`
  (console tokens, CLI tokens from before `cli_session`) gets 400
  `unsupported_token_type` pointing at `POST /auth/sessions/revoke-all`
  instead of a false success.

### Restricted CI identity foundation

`CiPrincipal` is an OSS machine principal with a versioned, typed grant for one
account-local project and its explicitly bound hosted flow. Separate `ApiKey`
rows have an explicit `restricted_ci` mode, version, principal reference and
optional narrower action ceiling. Tokens use the existing high-entropy hashed
key lifecycle and are disclosed once. Authentication reads current account,
principal, key and binding state, intersects action ceilings, and returns a
machine context with no human permissions. Scope enforcement audit/off settings
never relax this mode. The binding snapshots provider identity, clone path,
tracker host/type and organization lineage; changing any of these invalidates
access rather than redirecting an existing grant.

Human administrators provision a restricted CI identity through ten
authenticated `/api/v1/ci-identities` routes: capabilities, preview, list,
create, show, update, key issue, key rotate, key revoke, and
completion-subscription create. The console Restricted CI page and `preloop ci`
use that same lifecycle. Generic REST, MCP, model gateway, WebSocket and
session exchange authentication cannot treat a restricted key as its issuing
human. The legacy key management surface excludes these keys; human CI
administration must use the dedicated lifecycle seam.

The restricted ASGI guard covers every application role before handler work.
Only one canonical Bearer transport can enter an explicitly classified,
machine-aware HTTP handler. Duplicate or custom token transports, WebSockets,
streams, unclassified operations and generic credential/session exchanges deny.
An explicit test inventory includes lazy included routers, hidden routes and
mounted applications through their middleware wrappers. OpenAPI records each
operation's `x-restricted-ci` policy and authentication/authorization errors.

Machine-aware handlers use `get_current_actor` and an explicit `ci_action` on
`require_permission`; unmarked handlers reject machine actors, including direct
service calls. The machine branch never invokes the human RBAC/owner path.
CRUD revalidates key, principal, account, action and immutable binding before
protected work, so a retained request context cannot preserve revoked authority.
The optional machine account-policy hook can only deny this core ceiling;
missing hooks preserve OSS behavior and hook errors fail closed. Invalid
restricted credentials receive 401, forbidden operations receive 403, and
protected object handlers apply their consistent not-found policy. Decision
logs include safe machine/resource identifiers, never token or result contents.

The operation map permits the existing flow trigger, execution list,
execution detail, persisted result and stop-command routes, plus principal-owned
subscription list/create/update/delete and signing-secret rotation. All other
operations remain denied. Trigger accepts only `{"pr_number": 7, "head_sha": "<exact SHA>"}`;
the SHA is 40 or 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters. OpenAPI includes the
restricted request schema beside the ordinary human request contract. The server
reads the PR/MR by immutable repository ID using its trusted integration and
requires an open review, matching immutable repository identity, number and exact
head. v1 supports hosted GitHub and GitLab repositories; fork reviews and custom
GitHub hosts are refused. Effective GitLab hosts must match the approved binding.
No execution row or queue operation is created for an invalid review.

The accepted account, principal, project, flow, integration, repository, provider
PR identity, head and target branch are persisted with the execution. Attribution
and that snapshot cannot be edited or backfilled onto historical rows. The target
branch must be a conventional ASCII Git ref; its accepted value is included in
clone context, so a non-main target does not fall back to `main`. Dispatch checks
the current principal/grant/resource binding before queueing and re-reads the
provider review immediately before a new runtime launch. Provider failures block
launch with a generic `verification_blocked` failure, without recording provider
response bodies or credentials. Revoking only the initiating key does not cancel
accepted work; principal or trigger-grant removal blocks future launch. Recovery
of an already established runtime remains available to human administrators.

Machine list/detail/result/stop queries require the current key/grant and stable
principal ownership, before filtering, counting or pagination. Other principals,
human runs and null-owned history are inaccessible. Detail returns only review
correlation, status, timestamps and failure category. Result returns the same
correlation plus the persisted report with controller-private fields, prompts,
MCP logs and runtime credential/configuration fields removed recursively. A
missing result returns 404 even for a completed run. An agent-authored report is
not proof that a review was published to the provider; publication receipts must
be checked independently.

Stop accepts only `{"command": "stop"}` (an explicit null payload is also
accepted), with no other fields or command payload. It uses the existing runtime
teardown path, rechecks authority after connecting to the command bus, and is
idempotent for owned terminal runs. CI decides which PR/head is obsolete; this
endpoint does not enforce a supersession policy. v1 is one hosted execution:
matrix, retry, resume, delegation, flow-feedback loops and triage controllers are
excluded. Model, agent, runner, credentials, prompts and clone/workspace settings
remain administrator-controlled flow configuration.

Key rotation preserves principal-owned runs. Principal disablement or grant
removal denies subsequent API reads/stops without automatically terminating an
already running agent. An authorized human administrator uses ordinary execution
controls to inspect or stop that run. Restoring a grant requires the same approved
resource binding; moving a project/repository requires a new principal rather
than silently redirecting existing executions.

The account owner can administer through core CRUD. An optional edition hook
checks human operation/resource authority and may delegate or deny human
administration, while the core account, project, flow and action checks always
apply. Grant changes, disablement and key lifecycle changes are audited with
human, principal, key and resource/action identifiers, never token material.
Disabling an unusable binding or revoking its key remains possible for an
authorized administrator. Permission changes to the provisioning human do not
implicitly change the machine's persisted grant.

Execution and subscription ownership is nullable for historical rows and is
never guessed or backfilled. Rotation atomically replaces a key, preserving
principal ownership and narrowing to the previous key/current grant intersection.
Revoking one key does not stop existing work or transfer/delete owned resources.
Disable a principal to suspend all its machine access; stopping existing runs is
a separate administrator action. Principals and bound resources use restrictive
foreign keys to preserve attribution: retire identities by disabling them,
retain historical owned rows, and explicitly remove retained dependent records
before resource deletion. Deleting a human retains the principal's nullable
administration attribution; existing key/user deletion semantics still revoke
that human's keys. Schema rollback refuses restricted keys or retained principals
rather than erase machine markers and turn a CI key into an owner key.

**Multi-User Architecture:**
- **Account Model:** Represents an organization/company
- **User Model:** Represents individual users within an account
- All data is scoped by `account_id` for multi-tenancy isolation

**Security Features:**
- Password hashing with industry-standard algorithms
- Account-level data isolation (all queries filtered by `account_id`)
- User invitation system with secure token-based email verification
- Email verification and password reset links are bound to one user row (a
  `uid` claim next to the address). One address can hold a user in several
  accounts, so a link never resolves by address alone: it is refused if it has
  no `uid` (links minted before this binding) or if the row's address changed
  after it was sent, and the person requests a new one. The forgot-password
  and resend-verification forms send one link per row holding the address,
  each naming its username. `crud_user.get_by_email` raises
  `AmbiguousEmailError` rather than choose between rows; use `list_by_email`
  or an account scope.

**Plugin System:**
- Extensible plugin architecture for adding custom functionality
- Plugins can provide services, API routes, middleware, and dependencies
- Built-in plugins: Argument-based condition evaluator for approval workflows
- Plugin discovery via module paths or file system paths
- Lifecycle hooks: `on_startup()` and `on_shutdown()`

## Redaction Policy

Preloop redacts sensitive data before logging, persisting to audit surfaces, or sending notifications. The centralized redaction module (`preloop.utils.redaction`) provides:

- **`redact_dict(data)`**: Recursively replaces values for sensitive field names (e.g. `password`, `api_key`, `token`, `secret`, `credential`) with `***REDACTED***`.
- **`redact_for_log(data)`**: Produces a safe JSON string for log messages, with sensitive fields redacted and output truncated.

**Redaction is applied in:**
- MCP tool execution logs (tool arguments)
- Approval flow logs and notifications (tool args, approval URLs)
- Flow execution MCP usage logs (persisted to DB)
- Audit trail (configuration changes, tool executions)
- Approval request emails and Slack/Mattermost messages

**Known exceptions:** Approval URLs are not logged in full (replaced with `[sent via notification]`). Progress tokens and request context metadata are not logged. Tracker credentials and AI model API keys are not logged when present in payloads.

**Tests:** `tests/utils/test_redaction.py` asserts that representative secrets never appear in redacted output.


### Restricted CI completion callbacks

Restricted CI credentials manage only subscriptions owned by their stable
principal through the existing endpoint list/create/update/delete routes and
`POST /api/v1/event-webhooks/endpoints/{endpoint_id}/secret/rotate`. Each accepts
its specific subscription action. Create defaults to exactly
`flow.execution.finished`; explicit empty, mixed or duplicate filters, foreign
resource fields and ownership/configuration overrides are rejected. The binding
snapshots account, principal, project, flow and repository immutably; historical
account-wide endpoints are never inferred to be machine-owned.

Dispatch requires the stable principal's current `subscription:create` grant,
active account/principal and unchanged resource binding, plus any EE denial.
Removing that action or disabling the principal prevents future delivery,
including queued retries. Revoking an initiating API key blocks that key's API
use while retaining principal-owned subscriptions and accepted delivery rights.
Ownership is checked against the trusted persisted terminal execution when
queuing and again after a worker acquires a send slot, immediately before POST.
Partial or malformed machine markers are quarantined, with no human-envelope
fallback. Generic test-send, replay, delivery-history and dead-letter routes
remain denied to machine credentials; generic administrator replay excludes
machine subscriptions.

Human operators see a read-only restricted-CI marker and the fixed completion
filter. Synthetic test sends are explicitly rejected for these endpoints;
ordinary pause, receiver and deletion controls remain available. Permanent
authorization or private-target denials terminate a queued delivery without
POST. Transient DNS resolution and preparation/database failures consume a
failed attempt, release the claim and use normal backoff, circuit breaking and
dead-letter limits. Preparation logs contain delivery IDs and exception classes,
never exception contents or signing material.

The signed v1 envelope contains only execution/flow/project/repository, PR/MR
number/provider identity, exact head SHA, terminal status and result readiness.
Caller event data, runtime prompts, logs and report bodies never enter the
machine payload. Consumers verify HMAC freshness, deduplicate event IDs across
retries, match execution and expected head, then read that execution's persisted
result. A signed completion is not a review-publication receipt and a stale
head is not current review evidence.

Signing secrets are encrypted and returned once on creation or rotation.
Queued and retried sends use the current receiver URL and current secret with a
fresh signature timestamp. A request already in flight can still use the old
secret: receivers should accept both during their bounded rotation overlap and
deduplicate by event ID. Endpoint deletion removes its durable delivery history;
authority-denied queued machine deliveries are marked dead without POST. The
migration does not backfill and refuses downgrade while retained snapshots exist.
