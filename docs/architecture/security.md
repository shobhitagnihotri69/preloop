# Security Considerations

Editions: OSS. Contributor documentation for this repository.

Auth, tenancy, redaction, and secret custody are platform concerns, not agent self-reporting. This chapter covers the security checklist, redaction policy, secret service, the tamper-evident audit chain and record signatures, security-screen scoring, and `preloop.security`.

## Security Screen Scoring (QM Proxy Contract)
*   **Purpose:** Let external agent platforms delegate content security screening to Preloop through a documented HTTP contract, starting with QM's `securityScreen: { backend: "proxy" }` deployment option.
*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/security-screen/score` (`api/endpoints/security_screen.py`) accepts `{text, hook, metadata}` with the caller's token in `x-api-key` (Bearer fallback) and returns `{score, threshold, primary_outcome}`; `primary_outcome` is omitted for benign content. Auth reuses the model gateway's `authenticate_bearer_token`, so a standard Preloop API key is the routed credential.
*   **Scoring:** `services/security_screen.py` is a pure, deterministic rule engine: compiled case-insensitive regex categories (`prompt_injection`, `destructive_command`, `destructive_sql`, `secret_exfiltration`) with max-match-wins scoring. No I/O, no model calls, no persistence on the scoring path; the threshold comes from `PRELOOP_SECURITY_SCREEN_THRESHOLD` (default 0.7, clamped).
*   **Privacy:** Screened text is never logged or stored. Flagged chunks log score, outcome, matched rule names, and caller chunk coordinates only.
*   **Rollout Semantics:** Shadow vs enforce and fail-closed error handling live on the caller's side (per QM's contract); Preloop only scores.

## Secret Service
*   **Purpose:** Provider-agnostic custody and resolution of model credentials.
*   **Built-in Backend:** `local_encrypted` for encrypted-at-rest credentials stored in Preloop-managed storage.
*   **External Backends:** Optional Vault/OpenBao-compatible KV v2 references via `SecretReference.external_ref`.
*   **Runtime Boundary:** Gateway-enabled runtimes receive Preloop gateway tokens instead of provider API keys.

## preloop.security (`./backend/preloop/security`)
*   **Purpose:** Deterministic, server-side validation of security audit results. It is result validation, not scanning.
*   **Gap-Register Freeze:** `gap_register.py` validates the `result.json` produced by release security audit runs. Previous SHA+path finding rows are a floor: dropping one without a `resolved` marker plus a reason fails, unclassified rows fail, and `secrets_findings_count` must match the row count. The agent never self-grades the floor.
*   **Git Guard:** `git_guard.py` allow-lists metadata-only git invocations so no historical blob contents can be dumped into logs or transcripts. It has no production callers yet; it is the enforcement half of the planned follow-up that wires `validate_gap_register` into result ingestion.
*   **Waiver Inputs:** `waivers.py` deterministically factors human-authored waiver entries (`{id, reason, author, date}`, plus optional scope/expiry/package/version and the platform approval id for interactively collected ones) into a severity-gate outcome: alias-aware matching (a CVE id waives the same advisory surfaced under a GHSA/OSV alias), verbatim echo of applied entries, unmatched/invalid entries surfaced rather than dropped, and an unwaived failure always keeps the gate failed. Interactive `006` waivers bind stored `ask_user` `tool_result`/`responses` (exact finding id and human reason), not `status=approved` or question text. Ambiguous `request_approval` prose, including a `waive_finding` operation, is not a waiver. AI-judged and auto-approved rows cannot authenticate a human waiver or due-diligence decision. The severity gate is KEV or CVSS >= 9.0 unless trigger/CI `gate.fail_on_kev` / `gate.fail_on_cvss_gte` (in `[0, 10]`) override it: never model-authored `gate.policy` display text. There is no per-product policy table.
*   **Scanner Boundary:** Scanners (gitleaks, zizmor) are installed and run inside the agent execution sandbox per the release security audit preset (`backend/presets/006-release-security-audit.yaml`), never on the platform control plane.

## Tamper-evident audit trail and signed records
*   **Chain:** A background pass seals audit rows per account into a hash chain (`chain_seq`, `prev_hash`, `row_hash`). Editing, deleting, or reordering a sealed row breaks every hash from that point. Sealing is off the request path so a chain error cannot fail the audited action. Signed checkpoints over the chain head are the artifact a customer can keep off the platform.
*   **Keys:** One active Ed25519 key per account. The private half is Fernet-encrypted with `SECURITY__ENCRYPTION_KEY`; the public half is published. Rotation retires the old key without invalidating signatures it already made.
*   **Signatures:** Detached, over a digest, with the payload type inside the signed bytes so a period-export signature cannot be replayed as an evidence-pack signature. Evidence packs are signed at capture, not at download. Signing is never a precondition: an unsigned export or pack is still served.
*   **Verification:** `preloop audit verify` and `preloop evidence verify` recompute hashes and signatures on the caller's machine and tell the caller to trust that walk over the server's verdict. Operator guide: [Evidence storage and signed records](../guide/flows/evidence-storage.md).
*   **What this does not prove:** A compromised server can forge a record before it is signed. The chain is not WORM. Rows below the retention purge floor and rows not yet sealed are outside any result.

## Authentication & Authorization

Preloop implements authentication and multi-tenancy:

**Authentication:**
- JWT-based authentication for REST API and MCP endpoints
- Token-based authentication with refresh token support
- Email verification for new user accounts
- Integration points for SSO and OAuth providers (future)
- Per-user `auth_generation` (JWT `gen` claim). `POST /auth/sessions/revoke-all`
  increments it; `get_current_user`, `POST /auth/refresh`, the CLI JWT
  branch of `POST /oauth/token`, and the WebSocket upgrade
  (`WebSocketAuthMiddleware`) reject a token whose `gen` is behind the
  user. Tokens minted before the claim existed are treated as generation 0,
  so one bump also invalidates them. API keys and runner tokens are
  unchanged. `preloop auth logout --all` and the console Sign out everywhere
  control call that endpoint.
- Console refresh tokens (`POST /auth/refresh`) carry `sat` and are capped
  at `MAX_SESSION_DAYS` (default 30). CLI login refresh tokens stay
  long-lived (`CLI_JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`, default 365); revocation
  is the control for those, not the session cap.
- Each CLI login (`/oauth/token` without PKCE) records a `cli_session` row.
  Its access and refresh JWTs carry the row id as `sid`; the refresh token
  also carries a `jti` that must equal `cli_session.refresh_jti`. Rotation
  swaps the `jti` in one conditional UPDATE, so a refresh token that was
  already rotated away is rejected. Revoking the row (`POST /oauth/revoke`
  with either token, `DELETE /auth/sessions/cli/{id}`, `preloop auth logout`)
  rejects both tokens of that login in `get_current_user`, the WebSocket
  upgrade and the refresh path; other logins are unaffected.
  `POST /auth/refresh` does not accept a token with `sid`, so a CLI refresh
  token cannot be turned into console tokens that escape the row check.
  A CLI refresh token from before `sid` existed is moved onto a new row the
  next time it rotates; the old token itself stays covered by the
  generation check only.
- `POST /oauth/revoke` still revokes opaque MCP tokens. A JWT without `sid`
  (console tokens, CLI tokens from before `cli_session`) gets 400
  `unsupported_token_type` pointing at `POST /auth/sessions/revoke-all`
  instead of a false success.

**Multi-User Architecture:**
- **Account Model:** Represents an organization/company
- **User Model:** Represents individual users within an account
- All data is scoped by `account_id` for multi-tenancy isolation

**Security Features:**
- Password hashing with industry-standard algorithms
- Account-level data isolation (all queries filtered by `account_id`)
- User invitation system with secure token-based email verification
- Email verification and password reset links are bound to one user row (a
  `uid` claim next to the address). One address can hold a user in several
  accounts, so a link never resolves by address alone: it is refused if it has
  no `uid` (links minted before this binding) or if the row's address changed
  after it was sent, and the person requests a new one. The forgot-password
  and resend-verification forms send one link per row holding the address,
  each naming its username. `crud_user.get_by_email` raises
  `AmbiguousEmailError` rather than choose between rows; use `list_by_email`
  or an account scope.

**Plugin System:**
- Extensible plugin architecture for adding custom functionality
- Plugins can provide services, API routes, middleware, and dependencies
- Built-in plugins: Argument-based condition evaluator for approval workflows
- Plugin discovery via module paths or file system paths
- Lifecycle hooks: `on_startup()` and `on_shutdown()`

## Redaction Policy

Preloop redacts sensitive data before logging, persisting to audit surfaces, or sending notifications. The centralized redaction module (`preloop.utils.redaction`) provides:

- **`redact_dict(data)`**: Recursively replaces values for sensitive field names (e.g. `password`, `api_key`, `token`, `secret`, `credential`) with `***REDACTED***`.
- **`redact_for_log(data)`**: Produces a safe JSON string for log messages, with sensitive fields redacted and output truncated.

**Redaction is applied in:**
- MCP tool execution logs (tool arguments)
- Approval flow logs and notifications (tool args, approval URLs)
- Flow execution MCP usage logs (persisted to DB)
- Audit trail (configuration changes, tool executions)
- Approval request emails and Slack/Mattermost messages

**Known exceptions:** Approval URLs are not logged in full (replaced with `[sent via notification]`). Progress tokens and request context metadata are not logged. Tracker credentials and AI model API keys are not logged when present in payloads.

**Tests:** `tests/utils/test_redaction.py` asserts that representative secrets never appear in redacted output.
