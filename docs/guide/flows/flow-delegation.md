# Delegation: one flow running another with `run_flow`

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

A flow execution can start another flow of the same account as a child of
itself. The tool is `run_flow`, it is off by default, and every rule that
decides whether a call is permitted runs on the server.

Delegation is asynchronous by default. `run_flow` returns as soon as the
child execution row exists and never blocks the calling turn. A parent that
needs an outcome can poll with `get_execution`, or pass `wait` to wait for
every child this execution has started. The way it waits is a park: see
[Waiting for children](#waiting-for-children).

## Turning it on for a flow

Two independent switches, both on the calling flow:

1. `run_flow` in the flow's `allowed_mcp_tools`. The tool is default off, so
   an agent that has not been given it does not see it in its tool list and
   cannot call it by name either.
2. The target flow in the flow's `callable_flows` allowlist. Selecting the
   tool grants delegation in general; the allowlist decides what may be run.
   An entry may cap how many children of that flow one execution may start.

Neither switch implies the other. A flow with the tool and an empty
allowlist can call nothing; a flow with an allowlist and no tool cannot
delegate at all.

## What the agent passes

| Argument | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `flow` | Slug or name of the target, resolved inside the calling account |
| `payload` | Trigger payload for the child, readable as `{{trigger_event.payload.<key>}}` |
| `label` | Short label recorded on the child so siblings are distinguishable |
| `timeout_seconds` | Window for the child, clamped to the caller's own remaining time |
| `max_cost_usd` | Cost ceiling for the child and anything it delegates, clamped by the allowlist entry |
| `wait` | Wait for every child this execution has started, parking the run if they are slow. Default false |

Model and harness overrides inside `payload` are stripped: a child runs on
its own flow's routing, never on routing chosen by the calling agent.

## What comes back

One task record, in the delegation shapes frozen in
`docs/guide/flow-delegation-shapes.md`: the child execution id, the root of
the delegation tree as `contextId`, the state, and the depth. There are no
artifacts on a child that has not run and no cost on one that has spent
nothing.

A refusal is a record too, not an exception: state `TASK_STATE_REJECTED`
with `preloop.ai/refusalReason` naming the rule that declined the call. The
agent reads a reason instead of parsing prose.

## The rules, in the order they run

| Reason | The rule that declined |
| --- | --- |
| `tool_not_allowed` | `run_flow` is not on the calling flow's tool allowlist |
| `flow_not_found` | The reference names no flow in the calling account |
| `flow_not_callable` | The flow is disabled, or is not on the caller's `callable_flows` |
| `depth_exceeded` | The child would sit deeper than the configured maximum depth |
| `cycle_detected` | The target is already running above this execution |
| `fanout_exceeded` | This execution has reached its cap on direct children |
| `budget_exceeded` | The delegation tree cannot afford the child's cost ceiling |

Each check fails closed and each refusal is audited with the correlation id
of the call that was refused, so a refused delegation is visible next to the
executions it did not create.

The tool allowlist is read from the flow row at call time rather than from
the credentials the execution is holding, so revoking `run_flow` from a flow
takes effect on runs that are already in progress.

Two controls are not in this list because they are enforced before the call
reaches delegation at all: the account kill switch, which halts every tool
call while the `tools` scope is halted and every new execution while the
`flows` scope is, and the central access policy, whose deny stops a call
that the allowlist would otherwise have permitted. A delegated start is
refused by the halt exactly as a manual start is.

## What a tree may cost

Delegation makes one tool call able to start twenty five runs, so money is
a rule like any other and it is the last one checked.

Every child is admitted under a **cost ceiling** in USD. The agent may ask
for one with `max_cost_usd`; the allowlist entry's `max_usd_per_child`
lowers an ask that is too large (it clamps, it does not refuse, because the
operator has already answered that question); and
`FLOW_DELEGATION_DEFAULT_CHILD_USD` applies when neither says anything.

A ceiling covers a **subtree**, not one run. A child admitted at 5 USD may
spend 5 itself, or spend 2 and let the children it starts spend 3. That is
what stops a ceiling being avoided by delegating one level deeper.

A tree nobody delegated is covered by `FLOW_DELEGATION_MAX_TREE_USD`, which
counts the starting run's own spend as well: the ceiling is what the tree
costs, not what its children cost.

What is counted against an allowance:

| Row | Counts as |
| --- | --- |
| The execution the allowance belongs to | Its `estimated_cost` so far |
| A child that has finished | Its `estimated_cost`: what it did cost |
| A child still running | Its ceiling, or its subtree's spend if that is already larger: what it may still cost |

A running child counts at its ceiling on purpose. Counting it at its
current spend would admit a second fan out on the strength of work that has
not been paid for yet.

A child that does not fit is refused **before it starts**, with
`budget_exceeded` and a message naming what is left, so an agent can split
its remaining work instead of guessing. Children already running are never
killed to make room: a run killed halfway has been paid for and has
produced nothing. On PostgreSQL, admissions against one tree take a
transaction-scoped advisory lock on the root execution before reading the
snapshot, and hold it through the child insert, so two concurrent
`run_flow` calls cannot both admit against the same remaining allowance.

This is an admission rule layered on the existing budget policies, not a
replacement for them. `BudgetPolicy` (account, flow, api key, managed
agent) is unchanged and still applies to every execution in a tree exactly
as it applies to a run nobody delegated.

## Rolling the cost up

Every child of one execution is created with the same `batch_id`, derived
from the parent execution, so one fan out is a batch in the same sense a
matrix trigger is:

```
GET /flows/batches/{batch_id}/executions
```

returns the siblings and a rollup of their status, tokens, tool calls and
estimated cost, with no query written for delegation. The `flow_id` on that
response is the first row's: a fan out may call more than one flow, and each
row names the flow it ran.

The lineage columns answer the other question: the whole tree, at any depth,
is the root row plus every row whose `root_execution_id` names it, which is
the query the ceiling above is enforced with.

## Reading a child with `get_execution`

`get_execution` is the other half of the pair and the same two switches do
not apply to it: it needs only to be in the flow's `allowed_mcp_tools`, and
it is off by default like `run_flow`. There is no allowlist for reads,
because the scope is not configurable.

| Argument | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `execution_id` | The execution to read, as returned by `run_flow` |
| `include_result` | Whether to return the result payload. Default false |

### What it may read

This execution, and the executions below it: a child, a grandchild, anything
whose `parent_execution_id` chain reaches the caller. Nothing else, and the
scope is decided on the server from the calling execution's own identity, not
from an argument.

Everything out of scope is refused with one reason, `execution_not_found`,
and one message: a sibling, an unrelated execution of the same account, an
execution of another account and an id nobody ever issued are answered
identically. A refusal that distinguished them would answer "does this
execution exist?" for rows the caller cannot read, one guessed id at a time.

### What comes back

The same task record `run_flow` returns, filled in with what the execution
has actually done: its state and the Preloop status that state was mapped
from, its depth, the cost and tokens spent so far, and its result as an
artifact when it has finished and `include_result` was set. An execution that
is still running hands over no artifact, whatever the flag says: there is no
result until there is.

A terminal execution that failed carries its failure category on the status
message, under `preloop.ai/failureCategory`, next to the human readable error
text. That category is the coarse, closed vocabulary the rest of Preloop
groups failures by, so a parent can branch on it instead of matching on an
error string.

A result larger than `FLOW_DELEGATION_RESULT_MAX_BYTES` comes back truncated
rather than whole: the artifact carries the serialised document cut to the
cap, says so in its description, flags it with `preloop.ai/truncated`, and
points at `GET /flows/executions/{id}/result`, which still serves the whole
document. One tool call cannot fill the caller's context window with a
child's output.

Every call writes one audit row, permitted or refused, carrying the calling
execution and the correlation id of the call.

## Limits an operator can set

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_MAX_DEPTH` | `2` | Deepest a delegation tree may grow. A root run is depth 0, its child 1, its grandchild 2, so the default refuses a great grandchild. `0` disables delegation on the instance. |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_MAX_CHILDREN` | `25` | How many direct children one execution may start. Defaults to the matrix fan out ceiling, so one execution cannot start more work by delegating than by matrixing. |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_MAX_TREE_USD` | `50` | How much one delegation tree may commit in USD. `0` removes the instance ceiling and leaves only the per entry ones. |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_DEFAULT_CHILD_USD` | `2` | Ceiling for a child nobody named one for. `0` means an unnamed ceiling is unbounded, which inside a tree that has a ceiling is refused rather than admitted: pass `max_cost_usd`. |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_RESULT_MAX_BYTES` | `16384` | Largest result payload `get_execution` returns whole. A larger result is truncated, flagged and pointed at. |

An allowlist entry's own `max_children` is applied on top of the instance
ceiling: whichever refuses first, refuses.

## Waiting for children

`run_flow(wait=true)` waits for every child the calling execution has
started, not only the one that call created. A fan out is therefore started
with several calls and waited for once, on the last of them.

The wait has two phases.

1. **In process.** For `FLOW_DELEGATION_WAIT_SECONDS` the call simply waits
   and, if the children finish inside it, returns their completion records
   as the result of the call. A fast child never costs a park cycle. This
   mirrors the approval park after threshold.
2. **Parked.** Past that window the execution is parked on
   `WAITING_FOR_CHILDREN`: the container is released, the runner is freed,
   the runtime token is retired and the flow's timeout budget pauses. The
   run holds nothing while its children run. It is resumed as a new
   execution that natively continues the same agent session when the last
   tracked child reaches a terminal state.

Terminal means finished, not successful: completed, failed, stopped and
refused all release the parent. A parent that waits for six flows and gets
four failures resumes with four failures, which is the point.

### The honest limitation

The results arrive as the **next turn** of the run, not as the return value
of the `run_flow` call the agent made. No harness lets us inject a value as
the return of a tool call in a session that was already killed. This is the
same limitation the human park has: the resumed prompt carries a block with
one row per call, and the machine readable records live in the trigger
payload under `children`.

```
| execution | flow | label | final state | cost | result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1a2b... | Dependency Audit | frontend | SUCCEEDED | $0.4120 | attached |
| 3c4d... | Dependency Audit | backend | FAILED | $0.0900 | no result artifact |
| 5e6f... | Dependency Audit | infra | REFUSED (fanout_exceeded) | not recorded | nothing ran |
```

A call that was refused before anything ran is a row too: the parent asked
for it and never got it, so it is reported rather than silently missing.

### When a child never finishes

A parked parent has its own deadline, `FLOW_DELEGATION_CHILD_WAIT_SECONDS`.
When it passes, the parent resumes anyway and every child that is still
running is reported with an expired record saying so. The parent writes a
report with declared coverage instead of the platform reporting a missing
result. The children are left alone: a deadline is the parent giving up on
waiting, not an operator ending the work. An operator ending the work is the
next section, and it does stop the children.

If the resume never lands (a worker died between confirming the park and
claiming it), the execution monitor's sweep picks the parent up and resumes
it. Two children finishing in the same instant resume the parent exactly
once: the claim is a single conditional update, and the loser does nothing.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_WAIT_SECONDS` | `90` | How long `run_flow(wait=true)` waits in process before parking the run. `0` parks immediately. |
| `FLOW_DELEGATION_CHILD_WAIT_SECONDS` | `21600` | How long a parked parent waits for its children before it is resumed anyway with expired records. Six hours. |

## Stopping a parent parked on children

**Stopping a parent stops the flows it was waiting for.** An operator who
stops a tree stops it because it is costing too much or because it is doing
the wrong thing, and a stop that leaves the expensive half of the work
running is not the stop anybody asked for. The alternative, letting the
children finish and reaping their results, keeps work already paid for, but
it keeps it for a run that will never read it: nothing resumes a stopped
execution, so the results would land in a record nobody is waiting on while
the spend keeps climbing. Discarded work is a cost the operator chose; spend
after a stop is a cost the operator was not told about.

What happens, in order, when the stop arrives:

1. The parent leaves `WAITING_FOR_CHILDREN` first, terminally. From that
   write on, a child finishing cannot claim the park, the resume sweep does
   not list the row, and the park is closed rather than left claimable.
2. Every execution under that parent, at any depth, that is not already
   terminal is stopped: the status goes `STOPPED`, `stop_reason` names the
   parent, and the durable stop intent is written so a container or a
   runner's job is torn down by the same poll an account kill switch uses.
3. A child that had already finished is left exactly as it is. So is a child
   that finishes while the stop is in flight: its terminal state, its result
   and its cost are all kept, and the coverage reports it as having finished
   during the stop rather than as stopped by it.
4. If a child won the race and a resume execution already exists, that
   resume is stopped too. A resume is the parent carrying on, and the tree is
   what the operator stopped.

The parent's record then declares the coverage it reached, under
`_stop_coverage` in its trigger details:

```json
{
  "decision": "stop_children_with_parent",
  "stopped_at": "2026-09-16T09:12:44+00:00",
  "children_total": 3,
  "counts": {"completed": 1, "finished": 0, "stopped": 2, "finished_first": 0, "left_running": 0},
  "own_cost_usd": 0.5,
  "tree_cost_usd": 1.2
}
```

`tree_cost_usd` is what the tree had cost at the moment of the stop, the
parent's own spend included. The execution tree shows the same thing per row:
a child this stop ended carries its `stop_reason`, so the page distinguishes
"stopped with its parent" from "stopped" and from "finished before the stop".

A run that started flows and never waited for them is not parked on anything,
so stopping it stops that run only. Stopping a tree is not a refund: a child
that was stopped was still paid for, and nothing here adjusts billing.

## Reading the tree

Every delegated child carries its parent execution, the root of its tree,
and its depth, so a tree can be reconstructed from the execution rows alone
without a log. A child of a child keeps the root of the whole tree, not its
immediate parent.

The execution page shows that tree. Under the summary strip, a delegating run
lists what it started: one row per child with the flow, the label the caller
passed, the state, when it ran and for how long, and what it cost, expandable
to grandchildren and linked to each child's own page. A failed child shows its
failure category; a refused one is marked as refused and carries no cost,
because nothing ran. The header of the panel totals the subtree (launched,
succeeded, failed, refused, cost, tokens) and keeps the run's own cost beside
it, never added to it: "this run cost X, what it started cost Y" is the
question the panel exists to answer. A run that started nothing says so in one
line.

The same read is available directly:

```
GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{execution_id}/tree
```

It answers with the execution itself, every descendant of it, and a rollup
over those descendants in the same shape the batch listing uses. Asking a
child returns that child's own subtree. A tree larger than one read comes back
with `truncated: true`.
