# Security audit presets (CRA evidence packs)

These Apache presets turn a CI-emitted SBOM and optional build evidence
into a versioned `result.json` plus a human-readable evidence pack. They
shipped as `backend/presets/004` through `006` in 0.15.0; `007`
(Component Due Diligence) and the gap register / evidence storage /
waiver fields landed in a later release. Clone a preset into a flow,
attach a webhook (or a schedule), and retain the pack. The YAML prompts
are the contract; this page describes that contract.

## What this is not

This is **not** a conformity assessment, **not** a certification,
**not** legal advice, **not** an SBOM generator, and **not** an Article
14 filing.

The Cyber Resilience Act is Regulation (EU) 2024/2847. Article 14
reporting duties apply from 11 Sep 2026. The full CRA applies from
11 Dec 2027. Preloop does not file CRA Article 14 reports. Preloop does
not issue a Declaration of Conformity, a CE marking decision, or a
"compliant" verdict. These presets also do not constitute an EU AI Act
conformity assessment.

They produce machine-generated evidence for a human assessor. A
manufacturer (or the notified body or assessor that manufacturer
appoints) still has to do the assessment.

Every `result.json` and every markdown evidence file carries this line:

> Machine-generated evidence for conformity assessment support. Not a
> conformity assessment, certification, or legal advice.

## What you get

| Preset | What it does | result.json schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SBOM Verify | Format validity, NTIA / CRA Annex I Part II minimum elements, completeness vs delivered build manifests, license flags, provenance consistency | `preloop.cra.sbomaudit/v1` |
| SBOM Exploit Check | Components to CVEs via OSV.dev, known-exploited flags via CISA KEV, per-source screening matrix, severity gate | `preloop.cra.vulnscan/v1` |
| Release Security Audit | Both of the above in one execution, plus drift vs a previous run's `result.json`, optional [gap register](#preloopcrareleaseauditv1-release-security-audit) and [multi-repo evidence storage](#evidence-storage-architecture-multi-repo-products) | `preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1` |
| [Component Due Diligence Record](#component-due-diligence-record) | Agent legwork on one integrated component; a human carries the risk decision via approval; the record can land in a compliance repo | `preloop.cra.duediligence/v1` |

The audit presets follow the Observe / Eval pattern: no write tools
(except `ask_user` on the release audit for optional interactive waivers,
and `request_approval` on due diligence; the exploit check and release
audit additionally carry the read-only `resolve_sbom_upstreams` registry
lookup that enriches vendored Arduino/PlatformIO components for `osv_git`
screening); deterministic checks separated
from agent judgment (`checks[]` vs `assessments[]`); and the disclaimer
above on every artifact.

**One-minute verdict cover.** Every audit and review preset that writes
a human-readable report leads with a one-page cover so nobody has to
write a verdict summary by hand. On the audit family that is
`audit-report.md` (SBOM Verify and Release Security Audit),
`vuln-report.md` (SBOM Exploit Check), and `dossier.md` (Component Due
Diligence). The [full-repo review presets](repo-review-presets.md)
require the same cover on their report artifacts. The cover is a verdict
sentence first (matching `result.json`; on SBOM Exploit Check that is
`status` and `gate.passed`, because that schema has no top-level
`verdict`), then three labelled boxes in this order: What we checked /
What we did not check / What you should do next week. It is strictly one
page. The cover may only summarize findings already present in the body;
the "What we did not check" box is mandatory and may not be empty when
anything was out of scope. On SBOM Exploit Check that box includes
unscreened components by count from the source matrix. The machine
`result.json` contract is unchanged.

Retrieve the structured result with
`GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{execution_id}/result`. Download the
captured evidence tarball with
`GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{id}/evidence`. Operator runbook for
transport, receipts, and retention:
[Evidence storage and retention](evidence-storage.md).

## result.json contract

The agent writes `/workspace/result.json` as its final action. The
runner captures that file as a first-class execution artifact. The
`GET .../result` response is:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "<uuid>",
  "status": "SUCCEEDED | FAILED | STOPPED | TIMEOUT | CANCELLED | ...",
  "result": { }
}
```

`result` is the body below. Unknown envelope fields are `null`, never
invented. `checks[]` are deterministic facts. `assessments[]` are agent
judgment. `result.json` stays under 200 KB; large listings live in
`/workspace/evidence/` files referenced from `artifacts`.

`git` is `null` unless a repository was cloned into the workspace. On
the Release Security Audit, fill `git` only when exactly one repository
is checked out; with multiple checkouts set it to `null` (per-repo
identity lives in `evidence_storage.code_repos`).

### Shared evidence envelope

Every schema includes:

```json
{
  "schema": "preloop.cra.sbomaudit/v1 | preloop.cra.vulnscan/v1 | preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1 | preloop.cra.duediligence/v1",
  "flow": "sbom-verify | sbom-exploit-check | release-security-audit | component-due-diligence",
  "run_at": "ISO 8601 UTC",
  "git": {"remote": "...", "commit": "...", "branch": "...", "dirty": false},
  "tool_versions": {"<tool>": "<version or 'unavailable: reason'>"},
  "inputs_declared": {"<input>": "<what was actually delivered>"},
  "runner": {"kind": "hosted | self_hosted | null", "id": null},
  "regime_profile": "cra",
  "checks": [{"name": "...", "passed": true, "skipped": false, "details": "evidence"}],
  "assessments": [{"topic": "...", "judgment": "agent judgment, marked as such"}],
  "artifacts": {"<name>": "<workspace-relative path>"},
  "disclaimer": "Machine-generated evidence for conformity assessment support. Not a conformity assessment, certification, or legal advice."
}
```

`runner` is the one envelope field the platform overwrites. The agent
writes nulls because it cannot see which runner leased its job; the
persist boundary stamps the execution's actual runner. See [Keys the
control plane adds to the stored
result](#keys-the-control-plane-adds-to-the-stored-result).

### Incompletion envelope

Every schema above requires a full audit body, so a run that stops early
(an input that never arrived, an interactive waiver question nobody
answered) has nothing valid to write. It writes the incompletion
envelope instead:

```json
{
  "schema": "preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1",
  "flow": "release-security-audit",
  "run_at": "2026-09-08T10:15:00Z",
  "regime_profile": "cra",
  "verdict": "error",
  "incomplete": {"reason": "the waiver approval did not resolve in time", "stage": "PHASE 2"},
  "disclaimer": "Machine-generated evidence for conformity assessment support. Not a conformity assessment, certification, or legal advice."
}
```

`incomplete.reason` is required and must be prose. The schema's
completion signal must say `error`: `verdict` on SBOM Verify and Release
Security Audit, `status` on SBOM Exploit Check, both on Component Due
Diligence. `git`, `tool_versions`, `inputs_declared`, `runner`,
`checks`, `assessments` and `artifacts` may be included. Audit body
sections may not: a document that reports findings, a gate, or a
decision is claiming work, and claimed work is validated in full,
waiver authenticity included.

Two exceptions, on Release Security Audit only. The first is `scope`: a
run pointed at one project inside a repository has to say which project
the silence is about, and a project with no SBOM of its own is exactly
the case that stops early (see
[Auditing one project inside a repository](#auditing-one-project-inside-a-repository)).
It is validated in full, like the block below.

The second is `drift`. Drift is
measured before the gate and before any waiver question, so a run that
dies waiting for a human has usually finished it. A release audit that
wrote `evidence/drift-report.md` and left `drift` null told a human
reader that 16 components had disappeared and told every machine reader
that nothing had changed. The rule now runs both ways and applies to
finished audits too:

- `artifacts.drift_report` names a file, so `drift` must be an object;
- `drift` is an object, so `artifacts.drift_report` must name the file;
- the block is validated in full, including `baseline.schema`. Drift
  against an unidentified baseline is not drift.

An empty `new_vulns` list means "compared, nothing new". When the
baseline carries no vulnerability findings at all, say so in the report
and leave the lists empty: no baseline is not a clean baseline, and the
envelope's `verdict: "error"` already denies the release.

The platform stores the envelope as the result, **fails** the execution,
and denies the release with `run did not complete: <reason>`. Before
this, a graceful failure with no `schema` field was recorded as
`cra_result_missing` and the agent's explanation survived only under
`result.raw`, where nobody reads it. "The audit could not be completed
because a required human decision did not arrive" is itself a
compliance-relevant fact.

### `preloop.cra.sbomaudit/v1` (SBOM Verify)

Envelope plus:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "format": "spdx | cyclonedx",
    "spec_version": "SPDX-2.3",
    "generator_tool": null,
    "build_ref": null
  },
  "valid": true,
  "minimum_elements": {"passed": false, "missing": ["supplier: 12 components"]},
  "coverage": {
    "components": 214,
    "pct_with_version": 99.1,
    "pct_with_license": 92.5,
    "pct_with_identifier": 88.3,
    "unmatched_vs_build": ["kernel-module-foo"]
  },
  "license_flags": [
    {"component": "...", "license": "...", "flag": "deny | flag | missing"}
  ],
  "delta": null,
  "verdict": "pass | pass_with_findings | fail"
}
```

Verdict: `fail` = invalid SBOM, minimum elements absent, or a declared
SBOM digest that does not match the parsed file (missing inputs entirely
also yields `fail`); `pass_with_findings` = valid but findings exist
(coverage gaps, license flags, skipped cross-checks, provenance
contradictions); `pass` = clean. Build cross-checks are marked `skipped`
when no build manifests were delivered. `delta` is **always `null`** in
this standalone preset; only the Release Security Audit computes drift.

**Provenance consistency.** `checks[]` always carries a
`provenance_consistency` entry, passed or skipped. It compares what the
caller declared (generator, SBOM sha256, build ref, any "unmodified tool
output" claim) against what the file says: creator/tool metadata, the
digest of the bytes actually parsed, and machine-checkable signs of
post-processing such as byte-identical duplicate components or
dependency references with no matching `bom-ref`. A contradiction is a
finding about the declaration, recorded separately from findings about
the SBOM's content. Callers who reshape an SBOM before delivering it
(to fit a size limit, for instance) get told, instead of getting an
audit of the reshaped file that reads as an audit of their build.

This schema has no top-level `status` field. Completion is the
`verdict`. Artifacts: `audit_report` (`evidence/audit-report.md`),
`findings` (`evidence/findings.json`). The execution page Report tab reads
those `evidence/` paths from the pack.

  },
  "gate": {"policy": "fail on KEV or CVSS >= 9.0 (default)", "passed": false},
  "new_since_last_run": null

```

`status` is the **required** flow completion signal Preloop reads:
`success` when the scan completed and the report was written (regardless
of gate outcome or findings); `error` (plus a `reason` field) when the
scan could not be completed. A failed gate on a completed scan is still
`"status": "success"`.

`matchable` means screenable by at least one **database** source
(`osv_purl` or `osv_git`). Heuristic-only coverage does not make a
component matchable. Heuristic-only findings (`nvd_cpe` / `osv_distro`
with no database-source confirmation) are reported and labeled but do
**not** enter the severity gate.

Default gate when the payload provides none: fail on any KEV-listed
finding or CVSS ≥ 9.0. VEX suppressions (OpenVEX or CycloneDX VEX) are
applied to the gate but always echoed in `findings` with `vex_status`.
`new_since_last_run` is **always `null`** in this standalone preset.

`art14_candidates` lists KEV-listed CVE ids as a prioritisation signal
for a human. It is not a report, and Preloop does not file Article 14
notifications. `reporting` is the block that turns that list into an
answer with a clock: see
[CRA Article 14 reporting](#cra-article-14-reporting).

If a source's negative control comes back empty, that source is blind
(`method_blind: true`). Empty results from a blind source mean nothing.
A component every source is blind to is "not screenable by any
method", never "zero vulnerabilities".

Artifacts: `findings` (`evidence/findings.json`), `source_matrix`
(`evidence/source-matrix.json`), `report` (`evidence/vuln-report.md`).
The Report tab uses package, CVSS, KEV, fix and VEX columns when the
findings carry them.

`drift` is `null` when no previous `result.json` was delivered, and only
then: when a drift report exists in the evidence pack, the block must
carry what it states (see [Incompletion envelope](#incompletion-envelope)).
`gap_register` is `null` when no repository was attached. `evidence_storage`
is `null` when product mode was skipped (no checkouts). `scope` is `null`
when the whole repository was the unit of audit (see
[Auditing one project inside a repository](#auditing-one-project-inside-a-repository)).

Overall `verdict`: `fail` if the SBOM audit failed **or** the severity
gate failed after deterministic waiver application; `pass_with_findings`
if everything gated passed but findings, waived failures, or skipped
cross-checks exist; `pass` only when clean. If `sbom_audit.verdict` is
`fail`, `result.verdict` must be `fail`. A run with any applied waiver
can never end better than `pass_with_findings`.

Gap-register items appear in `checks[]` as `passed: false` and may
move a clean run to `pass_with_findings`. They never flip the severity
gate or `sbom_audit.verdict`. `not_checkable` is required.
`secrets_findings_count` must equal the SHA+path **finding** row count
(not the gitleaks count). A previous run's SHA+path set is a freeze
floor: dropping a row without `resolved` plus a reason fails platform
validation. `gap_register.ready` is true only when no item is gap or
partial and `secrets_findings_count` is 0. Stable item ids:
`cvd_policy`, `security_contact`, `support_window`,
`article14_runbooks`, `update_and_signed_ota`, `secrets_hygiene`,
`default_credentials_provisioning`, `repo_hygiene`, `key_management`,
`ci_secret_scanning`, `ci_sbom_job`, `debug_leakage`.

Waivers are human-authored inputs (`waivers.json` / `waivers.yaml` in
the seed, or payload `waivers`). The agent never authors a waiver. An
entry missing `id`, `reason`, `author`, or `date` is invalid and waives
nothing. Interactive collection (`waiver_collection: "interactive"`)
uses the built-in `ask_user` channel once, batched, and asks for a
structured answer: the call carries one `items` row per unwaived gate
failure (id, package, severity, KEV badge) and an `input_schema` with a
`waived` array of `{id, reason}`. The console renders that as a form (a
checkbox and a reason box per finding), so nobody types JSON, and the
agent applies the returned array directly (from the in-process tool
result, or from the parked `_answers_prompt` block after a resume).
`author` and `date` are marked `x-autofill` and stamped by the platform
from the approval record, never typed and never model-authored. Persist
authenticates that stored `tool_result` / `responses` content —
`status=approved` or a CVE
mentioned in the question is not a waiver. Timeout fails closed.

The severity gate is KEV, CVSS >= 9.0, or a database-source finding
with **no CVSS score at all**, unless the trigger/CI payload sets
`gate.fail_on_kev` / `gate.fail_on_cvss_gte` (CVSS in `[0, 10]`) /
`gate.fail_on_unscored`. Agent `gate.policy` display text never changes
the threshold. There is no per-product policy table.

**Unscored findings are gate-relevant by default.** Go and Rust
advisories routinely reach OSV with no CVSS vector. Under a score-only
gate every one of them passes silently, and the pack then reads as
"screened and cleared" when it means "never scored". Unscored failures
are labeled `UNSCORED` on the cover and in the register, and they are
waivable like any other gate failure. Set
`gate.fail_on_unscored: false` in the payload (or
`ReleasePolicy(fail_on_unscored=False)` in CI) to opt out; the gate line
then says so. Heuristic-only findings are unaffected: they never enter
the gate, scored or not.
Interactive waivers wait on a human timescale. The preset sets
`approval_window_seconds: 259200` (3 days), and while the question is
outstanding the execution is **parked**: the container and the runner are
released, the status is `WAITING_FOR_HUMAN`, and the flow's
`timeout_seconds` budget is paused (waiting costs no agent time). The
decision, from the console, mobile, the API or a public approval link,
resumes the same agent session with the answer attached. If nobody
answers before the window closes, the run is resumed with an explicit
`expired` answer so the agent finishes its report with the finding
unwaived, instead of the platform reporting a missing result.

Set the window per flow (`approval_window_seconds`, seconds, from 60 up
to the account cap, 30 days by default), or per call by passing
`timeout_seconds` to `ask_user` / `request_approval`; the call can only
ask for a shorter window than the flow allows. Approvers are re-notified
through their existing notification preferences at 50 percent and 90
percent of the window.

Agents that can natively continue a session (Claude, Codex, Gemini,
OpenCode) resume in place, with the workspace snapshot restored. An agent
kind that cannot resume a session is restarted from the beginning with
the decision in the trigger payload under
`payload.answers.<request_id>`, so a flow that is expensive to restart
should prefer a resumable harness for interactive waivers.

The severity gate is KEV or CVSS >= 9.0 unless the trigger/CI payload
sets `gate.fail_on_kev` / `gate.fail_on_cvss_gte` (CVSS in `[0, 10]`).
Agent `gate.policy` display text never changes the threshold. There is
no per-product policy table.

Heuristic sources stay labeled and never enter the severity gate.
`pkg:generic` and `pkg:github` are not db-resolvable by purl; they may
still be screenable on `osv_git` when a `vcs_url` qualifier is present.
Vendored Arduino/PlatformIO components without a `vcs_url` are first
resolved through the built-in `resolve_sbom_upstreams` tool (public
Arduino library index + PlatformIO registry, read-only): a resolution
requires a registry-confirmed name+version match and is never
fabricated. Resolution provenance is reported per SBOM in the additive
nullable `inventory.upstream_resolution` block (`registry_resolved` /
`vcs_url_present` / `unresolved`); unreachable registries leave the
affected components blind and recorded, never guessed.

When a repository is attached, the gap-register phase installs and
runs **gitleaks** (recommended pin 8.24.3, git mode, full history,
`--redact`) and **zizmor** (recommended pin 1.16.0, GitHub Actions
workflows) inside the execution sandbox. Untrusted-repo work runs in
the governed sandbox, never on the Preloop API server. Secret values
never appear in any artifact: findings are commit SHA plus path only.

Artifacts include `audit_report`, `findings`, `source_matrix`,
`waivers` (or `null`), `sbom_findings`, `gap_register` (or `null`),
`drift_report`.

#### Auditing one project inside a repository

A repository holding many independently built projects is not one
product. Pass a repository-relative `project_path` in the trigger
payload and that path becomes the unit of audit for the whole run, the
way `target_repo_path` and `focus_paths` already scope the code health
review:

```json
{"project_path": "projects/device-gateway"}
```

- **Default is unchanged.** No `project_path` (absent, empty or `null`)
  means the whole repository, `scope` is `null`, and every other part of
  the run behaves as it did before this input existed. Results written
  before the field stay valid: `scope` is additive and nullable, and the
  schema is still `preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1`.
- **The path is validated first.** It must be relative to the
  repository root, carry no `..` segment, and exist in the checkout. A
  bad path is a bad input: the run writes the incompletion envelope
  naming the rejected value in `incomplete.reason` (for example
  `project_path '../other-repo' escapes the checkout`) rather than
  quietly auditing the whole repository. Do not put a rejected path
  into `scope.project_path`; the validator refuses any scope block
  whose path escapes the checkout, so that envelope would be discarded.
  The scope block is not required for this case.
- **Discovery is scoped.** SBOM lookup, the gap-register file walk,
  gitleaks, the history pickaxe and zizmor all run inside the path. An
  SBOM belonging to a sibling project is not this project's SBOM and is
  never read.
- **Every pointer is inside the path.** A repository-level file outside
  the project (a root `SECURITY.md`, a root workflow) is not this
  project's evidence: the item is recorded in
  `gap_register.not_checkable` with a reason naming where the evidence
  actually lives. The platform rejects a scoped result whose
  `gap_register` pointers or `scope.sbom_paths` leave the path. Commit
  SHAs and prose are not path pointers and are left alone.
- **The verdict says what it covers.** `scope.covers` is `project`, and
  the `audit-report.md` verdict sentence names the audited path and says
  the verdict covers that path only.

**No SBOM for the project: `not_checkable`.** This family verifies
SBOMs and refuses to generate them, so a project with no SBOM of its own
is an absence of evidence, not a clean bill of health. The run writes
the [incompletion envelope](#incompletion-envelope) with `verdict:
"error"` and a scope block that says so:

```json
{
  "schema": "preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1",
  "flow": "release-security-audit",
  "run_at": "2026-09-15T10:00:00Z",
  "regime_profile": "cra",
  "verdict": "error",
  "incomplete": {"reason": "no SBOM was delivered for projects/device-gateway", "stage": "PHASE 0"},
  "scope": {
    "project_path": "projects/device-gateway",
    "covers": "project",
    "status": "not_checkable",
    "reason": "no SBOM available"
  },
  "disclaimer": "Machine-generated evidence for conformity assessment support. Not a conformity assessment, certification, or legal advice."
}
```

The word is `not_checkable`, in the result envelope, in the report and
here, and it is never `skipped`: a skipped check reads as a choice, and
this is a missing input. The reason is required and must be non-empty.
There is no fallback to reading manifests or lockfiles, because a
reconstructed inventory is not a verified SBOM. A `not_checkable` lens
can never carry `pass` or `pass_with_findings`, and it can never carry
an audit body either: a document reporting a gate or findings is
claiming work, and there was none to claim.

### `preloop.cra.duediligence/v1` (Component Due Diligence)

Envelope plus:

```json
{
  "component": {
    "name": "...",
    "version": "...",
    "purl": null,
    "supplier": null,
    "homepage": null
  },

      {

        "covers": "..."
      }
    ],

    },

      ]
    },
    "ce_declaration": {
      "present": false,
      "document": null,
      "issuer": null,
      "date": null,
      "authenticity_verified": false
    },
    "license": {"declared": null, "flags": []},
    "open_unknowns": ["<what could not be determined and why>"]
  },
  "decision": {
    "outcome": "accepted | rejected | pending",
    "decided_via": "preloop_approval",
    "approval_operation": "<exact operation string sent to request_approval>",
    "reviewer": null,
    "note": "Reviewer identity and decision timestamp are in the Preloop approval audit trail for this execution."
  },
  "record": {
    "compliance_repo": null,
    "repo_commit": null,
    "path": null,
    "committed": false
  },
  "status": "success | error",
  "verdict": "recorded | error"
}
```

`status` is the required flow completion signal. `verdict` is
`recorded` only when the legwork completed **and** a human decision
(`accepted` or `rejected`) was captured; otherwise `error`. A
`rejected` decision is still a successfully **recorded** decision. A
granted approval means one reviewer accepted the component's risk for
this product at this time; it is not a certification.

`authenticity_verified` is always `false`: the preset reports presence
of a supplier CE declaration document, never its authenticity.

`reviewer` is always `null` in the record. Reviewer identity lives in
Preloop's approval audit trail.

### Keys the control plane adds to the stored result

The stored `result` is the agent's document plus a small number of keys
the platform owns. They are not part of any `preloop.cra.*` schema and
the agent cannot write them: an agent-authored copy is stripped or
renamed before the result is saved. Reading the raw JSON, you will see:

| Key | Written by | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runner` | control plane, over the agent's field | Where the run executed: `{"kind": "hosted" \| "self_hosted", "id": <runner id or null>, "attested_by": "control_plane"}`, plus `pool` when the run was queued to one. The agent cannot see which runner leased its job, so every preset tells it to write nulls and the persist boundary replaces them. |
| `container_termination` | the executor's runtime observation | How the sandbox ended: `reason`, `oom_killed`, `exit_code`. The only evidence that a run died rather than concluded. A `result.json` claim of this key is discarded. |
| `dossier_manifest` | control plane, on product-evidence runs | `preloop.cra.dossier_manifest/v1`: content digests over the raw agent result, the annotated result, the declared source inputs, artifact references, approvals and publication receipts. It is large (on a real 004 run, 39,815 bytes of a 92,796 byte result) because it restates identity in canonical, hashable form. See [Product evidence](product-evidence.md#dossier-manifest). |
| `product_provenance` | control plane, from the trigger | The caller's declared product mapping, echoed onto the result so the dossier and the evidence receipt describe the same artefact. |
| `trusted_publication`, `evidence_upload`, `verification` | control plane | Publication receipts, evidence-archive receipt, and the runner-captured verification verdict. |

`runner` is a fact about the platform, not about the audit: it does not
enter any verdict or gate. `container_termination` is the field to read
first when a run has no audit body.

## When the platform corrects a verdict

The verdict is derivable from the audit's own fields: an SBOM whose
minimum elements failed is a `fail`, coverage below 100 percent is at
least `pass_with_findings`, a failed severity gate is a `fail`. A run
that measures everything correctly and then writes the wrong label used
to be discarded whole, `cra_result_invalid`, evidence pack and all.

The persist boundary now rewrites the label and records what it did:

```json
"verdict": "fail",
"verdict_corrected": [
  {
    "path": "result.verdict",
    "submitted": "pass_with_findings",
    "corrected": "fail",
    "reason": "valid=True, minimum_elements.passed=False",
    "corrected_by": "platform_contract_validator"
  }
]
```

Two limits make this safe to rely on:

- **The verdict label only moves toward more severe.** `coverage`,
  `license_flags`, the findings and the gate stay as the agent wrote
  them. `minimum_elements` is replaced only when the platform measured
  the delivered bytes and the agent's `passed: true` contradicts that
  measurement (see below). `counts_by_severity` is replaced only when
  it disagrees with the findings list.
- **Never less severe.** `pass` to `pass_with_findings` and anything to
  `fail` are applied; `fail` to `pass` is refused and the result still
  fails closed, because that direction is the platform clearing a
  release it was handed as denied. An agent who already failed minimum
  elements keeps that claim.

The corrected result is then re-validated in full. If anything else in
the contract is also wrong, the run fails closed exactly as before, with
the raw document under `result.raw`. Presets are not told about this:
the contract still requires the agent to write the correct verdict, and
the repair exists so one enum does not cost a complete, digest-verified
audit.

## What our own SBOMs carry

The release SBOMs (`scripts/generate_sbom.sh`, stamped by
`scripts/sbom_metadata.py`) set a supplier on each component, not only on
the document. The name comes from installed Python `METADATA` (author, then
maintainer, then `pyproject.toml` in that wheel), from `package.json`
(`author`, `maintainers`, `contributors`, then the npm scope), or from a module or repository path (`The Go Authors` for `std` and
`golang.org/x`, the GitHub org, or host plus first path segment). The
path rule also applies to an npm `repository` field or a repository URL
already on the component when no person and no scope are present.
`author` is left as author. Each
derived component records `preloop:supplier_source`
(`package_metadata_author`, `package_metadata_maintainer`, `npm_scope`,
`module_path`, `manual_override`, or `unresolved`). `manual_override` is a
checked-in name for a distribution whose files name no person and no
repository. The `sbom` job fails when
`python -m preloop.cra measure` reports `passed: false`.

OpenVEX for the CLI lives in `security/vex/preloop-cli.openvex.json` and is
copied into the SBOM artifact and the GitHub release next to the CycloneDX
files.

## What the platform measures itself

`minimum_elements` on an SBOM audit used to be the agent's own claim. The
platform now measures the delivered SBOM bytes (CycloneDX 1.4 to 1.6 and
SPDX 2.2 and 2.3, including gzip) and stores that object on the result as
`minimum_elements_measured` (on the nested `sbom_audit` for a release
audit). The denominator is every component except the document's root
product. A supplier is `supplier.name` (SPDX: `supplier` other than
`NOASSERTION`). Author, authors, publisher and manufacturer are counted
separately and do not satisfy supplier. A unique identifier is a purl or
a CPE.

If the agent reports `passed: true` and the measurement finds missing
elements, the platform replaces `minimum_elements` with the measured
object, keeps the agent's claim on `verdict_corrected`, and lets the
existing verdict floor move the label to `fail`. That replacement is the
measurement of the delivered bytes becoming the authority. The agent's
field was a claim, not a measurement the platform is rewriting. If the
agent is already stricter than the measurement, the agent's value stays.
If no SBOM seeds are reachable, the platform does not guess: the same key
records why measurement was skipped, and the rest of the contract behaves
as before.

`counts_by_severity` is arithmetic over the findings list the agent
submitted. When that aggregate is the only contract failure, the platform
recomputes it, records each key as reported versus derived on
`verdict_corrected`, and re-validates in full. Findings are not edited.
A count mismatch together with any other failure still fails closed, and
the other failure is what is reported. An agent's evidence-pack prose that
repeats the wrong number is left as the agent wrote it.

A run is never made less severe by the platform. Corrections move a
verdict toward `fail`, replace a passing minimum-elements claim that the
bytes contradict, or replace an aggregate that does not match the
findings. They do not clear a release the agent denied.

## CI runbook

One copy-paste path: clone the preset, fire the webhook after the build
with inline `workspace_files`, poll `/result`, gate on the verdict,
retain the evidence tarball.

### 1. Clone the preset and attach a webhook

In the console, clone **Release Security Audit** (or SBOM Verify / SBOM
Exploit Check). Presets ship without a bound model; clone fails closed
with a 422 if the account has no usable model for that agent. Enable a
webhook trigger and copy the webhook URL. The inbound path is:

```
POST /api/v1/webhooks/flows/{flow_id}/{webhook_secret}
Content-Type: application/json
```

The webhook itself is unauthenticated; the secret in the URL is the
credential. The JSON body becomes the trigger payload (see
[webhook triggers](../../webhook-triggers.md)). A 200 response includes
`execution_id` so CI can poll. `execution_url` is the console page, not
the API.

`GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{execution_id}` and
`GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{execution_id}/result` require an account
API token (`Authorization: Bearer`, same `PRELOOP_TOKEN` as
[trigger a flow from CI](ci-trigger.md)). The token needs `view_flows`.

### 2. Deliver the SBOM inline

Prefer **inline** [`workspace_files`](../../webhook-triggers.md)
(base64; 96 KiB encoded per file, 1 MiB encoded across all files, 50
files). Payload field names are conventions the prompt understands; the
agent also searches `/workspace` for SBOM-shaped files.

The seed budget is **not** shared with the rendered prompt. Seeds travel
in the container environment and the launch command references them by
name, so a preset with a long prompt gets the same seed allowance as one
with a short prompt. The trigger endpoints validate the declaration
before an execution exists: `400` for a malformed one, `413` for an
oversized one, in both cases naming the cap, the actual size and the
overage.

URL delivery is allowed (`sbom.urls` and similar) but is hostile input:
anyone holding the webhook secret can inject them, and the exec
sandbox needs egress to the vulnerability sources, so the runner does
**not** guarantee egress filtering. The prompts instruct the agent to
fetch only http(s) URLs and to refuse targets resolving to loopback,
private-range, link-local, or cloud metadata addresses (e.g.
`169.254.169.254`), but this is prompt-level hardening, not a network
policy. Prefer inline `workspace_files` where integrity matters; a
platform-level egress allowlist is an open question.

Example payload (Release Security Audit):

```json
{
  "release_ref": "v1.2.3",
  "product": "example-product",
  "build": {
    "image_name": "example-image",
    "image_hash": "sha256:...",
    "toolchain": "yocto-5.0"
  },
  "sbom": {"paths": ["sbom/image.spdx.json"]},
  "manifests": {"license_manifest_path": "manifests/license.manifest"},
  "license_policy_path": "policy/licenses.yaml",
  "gate": {"fail_on_kev": true, "fail_on_cvss_gte": 7.0, "fail_on_unscored": true},
  "previous_result_path": "previous/result.json",
  "workspace_files": [
    {"path": "sbom/image.spdx.json", "content_base64": "..."},
    {"path": "manifests/license.manifest", "content_base64": "..."},
    {"path": "previous/result.json", "content_base64": "..."}
  ]
}
```

#### Where `workspace_files` goes in the body

A webhook body **is** the trigger payload, so the example above is
delivered exactly as written. The manual trigger endpoint
(`POST /api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/trigger`) is different: its body is the
whole trigger event, and flow inputs conventionally sit under a
`payload` object. Both of these are accepted and mean the same thing:

```json
{ "payload": { "release_ref": "v1.2.3", "workspace_files": [ ... ] } }
```

```json
{ "payload": { "release_ref": "v1.2.3" }, "workspace_files": [ ... ] }
```

The lookup is `payload` first, then the top level, and it is the same
for `product_provenance`. Declaring `workspace_files` in **both** places
is a `400`: two lists describe two different runs, and neither reading
of the request is more correct than the other.

Until preloop/preloop#509 only the first shape seeded anything. The
second was accepted with `200`, stored on the execution, and seeded
nothing, so the agent started with an empty `/workspace` and spent a
whole run finding out. If you are reading an execution from before that
fix, check `_workspace_file_paths` on the trigger snapshot: no such key
means no files were seeded, whatever the request said.

Top-level keys are otherwise free-form and usable as
`{{template}}` variables, with one exception: keys the platform writes
itself (`_resume`, `_answers`, `_answers_prompt`, `_feedback_prompt`,
`_ci_failure`, `_workspace_file_paths`, `_subject`) are rejected with a
`400` naming the key rather than being quietly accepted.

Recommended CI job outputs to retain and deliver: the SPDX / CycloneDX
file(s), the license manifest (e.g. Yocto `license.manifest`), image or
package manifests for cross-checks, and the previous audit's
`result.json` if you want drift. Optional: VEX file, license policy,
human-authored `waivers.json`.

If the encoded `workspace_files` would exceed a cap, do not silently
truncate and do not reshape the artefact to fit. An SBOM edited to fit a
transport produces findings about the edit rather than about the product,
and nothing in the evidence pack would let a reader tell the difference.
Gzip the artefacts and decompress them in a setup command, fail the job,
or switch to URL delivery with the trust warning above in mind.

### 3. GitHub Actions (`python -m preloop.cra.ci`)

Store `PRELOOP_URL` (API origin, no trailing slash), the full webhook URL
(including the secret) as `PRELOOP_CRA_WEBHOOK_URL`, and
`PRELOOP_TOKEN` (account API token with `view_flows`) as repository
secrets. The webhook URL is a bearer secret: do not print it, and do
not retry the POST after an ambiguous network or HTTP 5xx error.

The helper validates `result.json` against the CRA contracts, requires a
bounded gzip evidence archive (the durable `FLOW_EVIDENCE_MAX_BYTES` /
`FLOW_ARTIFACT_EXPANDED_MAX_BYTES` caps), binds the controller digest,
and compares packed SBOM/finding content rather than schema/verdict/status
alone. Default legacy capture may omit `result.json` from the tarball;
those packs are accepted only with a matching controller digest plus the
authenticated API result. Release is denied on `fail` or unknown
verdicts. Default policy is a clean `pass` only. `pass_with_findings` is
an explicit `--policy pass_with_findings` choice. There is no
failure-bypass mode.

See [Evidence storage and retention](evidence-storage.md) for transport,
receipts, and retention.

Overall deadline is the selected flow's `timeout_seconds` plus a 120s
startup buffer (Release Security Audit is 7200s). Set
`PRELOOP_CRA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` or `--timeout` when the flow does not
report a timeout.

This job assumes a prior step wrote `sbom/image.spdx.json` and that the
job image can import `preloop` (the instance's Python environment, or
`pip install` of the same release).

Gating notes:

- Execution status `SUCCEEDED` means the flow completed. A `fail`
  verdict is still a completed audit (execution succeeded, release
  denied). Do not treat a green execution as a clean pack.
- Default `--policy pass` accepts only a clean pack. Use
  `--policy pass_with_findings` when your product policy allows findings.
  `fail` and unknown verdicts always deny release.
- For SBOM Exploit Check, the helper requires `result.status == "success"`
  and `result.gate.passed is true` (boolean true, not `1` / `"true"`).
  Findings still need `--policy pass_with_findings`.
- Schema validation and a verified evidence receipt are required.
  Operator policy cannot turn missing, empty, HTML, or corrupt evidence
  into acceptance.
- Retain `result.json` and the evidence tarball even when the gate
  fails, including FAILED / TIMEOUT executions. The helper does not
  retrigger the webhook.

### Scheduled re-audits

CRA vulnerability handling continues through the support period even
when you ship nothing. Attach a schedule trigger (cron / interval) to a
cloned **Release Security Audit** or **SBOM Exploit Check** flow that
re-delivers the *last released* SBOM (plus the previous `result.json`
for drift). Each run produces a dated evidence pack; the run-over-run
trail is the auditable record.

## CRA Article 14 reporting

From 11 September 2026 a manufacturer must report an **actively exploited
vulnerability in its product**: an early warning within 24 hours of becoming
aware, a vulnerability notification within 72 hours, and a final report within
14 days. A list of KEV-listed CVE ids does not answer that question, and it
carries no clock. The `reporting` block does both.

**Preloop does not file anything.** There is no submission client for the
ENISA single reporting platform and none is planned here: the filing decision
and the filing itself stay with the manufacturer, who signs it. What the
platform does is tell you, in one place and in one sentence, that a clock is
running and when it stops.

### The block

`reporting` lives next to `art14_candidates`: at the top level in
`preloop.cra.vulnscan/v1`, under `vuln_scan` in `preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1`.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `assessment` | `no_reportable_vulnerability`, `reportable_candidate` or `undetermined` |
| `basis` | One sentence naming the evidence that decided it |
| `kev_snapshot_date` | The `dateReleased` of the KEV catalogue actually fetched, or `null` when the fetch failed |
| `kev_source_url` | The URL actually fetched (cisa.gov or the `cisagov/kev-data` mirror) |
| `candidates[]` | One entry per actively exploited vulnerability |
| `not_a_legal_determination` | Always `true` |

Per candidate:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | CVE or advisory id |
| `actively_exploited` | Exploitation evidence exists |
| `exploited_evidence` | `kev`, `vendor_advisory` or `none`: what the run actually read |
| `affected` | `{value, source, detail}`: the **product** determination, `true` / `false` / `"undetermined"`, sourced from `vex`, `reachability`, `manual` or `unknown` |
| `vex_status` | The VEX status on the finding, when there is one |
| `reportable` | Exactly `actively_exploited AND affected.value == true` |
| `discovered_at` | When the organisation became aware, in UTC |
| `deadlines` | `early_warning_24h`, `notification_72h`, `final_report_14d` |
| `status` | `none`, `drafted`, `submitted` or `out_of_scope` (with `status_reason`) |

### Rules the validator enforces

- The block is **required** whenever any finding is KEV-listed, and every
  KEV-listed finding must appear as a candidate. An absent block reads as
  "nothing to report", which is the failure this exists to prevent.
- `reportable` is derived, not asserted. A candidate that claims
  `reportable: true` with `affected.value: false` is rejected.
- `actively_exploited: true` with `exploited_evidence: "none"` is rejected:
  name the evidence or do not make the claim.
- An `affected.value` of `true` or `false` with `source: "unknown"` is
  rejected. An unsourced call is `"undetermined"`.
- `assessment` must be `undetermined` whenever the KEV fetch failed
  (`kev_snapshot_date: null`), the scan did not complete, or any candidate's
  affectedness is undetermined. It may only be `no_reportable_vulnerability`
  when every candidate was determined not affected or not exploited.
- The three deadlines must equal `discovered_at + 24h / + 72h / + 14d`, all
  measured from the same instant, in UTC (one second of serialization drift is
  tolerated). Chained or hand-written deadlines are rejected.

### The clock starts once

`discovered_at` is the **earliest** time the vulnerability was seen, not the
time of the run that reported it. When the drift baseline already carried the
id, the baseline's timestamp is used. A nightly re-audit therefore never
restarts a 24 hour clock, and a deadline that has already passed keeps reading
as passed.

### VEX is what clears a report

A delivered VEX statement of `not_affected` with a justification (for example
`vulnerable_code_not_present`) sets `affected.value` to `false` with
`source: "vex"`, which makes the candidate non-reportable and, on its own,
takes the finding out of the severity gate (recorded in `gate.vex_suppressed`
with the statement id and the justification). This is the one determination
that most often distinguishes "on KEV" from "reportable".

A **waiver never clears a report**. Waiving a gate failure is a release
decision by a named human; it says nothing about whether the product is
affected by an exploited vulnerability.

### SBOM Verify says "undetermined", loudly

`preloop.cra.sbomaudit/v1` carries the same block hard-coded to:

```json
{
  "assessment": "undetermined",
  "basis": "SBOM verification does not screen for vulnerabilities; run preset 005 or 006",
  "kev_snapshot_date": null,
  "kev_source_url": null,
  "candidates": [],
  "not_a_legal_determination": true
}
```

Any other assessment is rejected, and candidates must be empty. An operator
who runs only SBOM Verify must be able to see that the question has not been
asked, which is not the same as the answer being no.

### In the audit report

`evidence/audit-report.md` opens the Article 14 box immediately after "What we
did NOT check", before the VEX and waiver sections, with one sentence in the
same place every time:

> Reportable under CRA Article 14? No / Candidate, see `reporting` /
> Undetermined, scan incomplete. Not legal advice.

Each candidate is then written out in plain words with the clock as dates and
times, so a duty officer reading the cover page can act without parsing JSON.

### The webhook

When a candidate is `reportable`, the platform emits
`cra.reportable_vulnerability` through
[outbound event webhooks](../webhooks.md), one event per candidate, with the
deadlines the run computed. The event id is deterministic on
(execution, CVE), so a redelivery or a re-emit is the same event and
receivers deduplicate on `X-Preloop-Event-Id`. `occurred_at` is
`discovered_at`, not the send time: the envelope timestamp and the clock in
the payload agree.

The payload carries `not_a_legal_determination: true` and
`filing_is_manufacturer_responsibility: true`. Routing it into a ticket queue
automates a notification, never a filing.

## Honest limits

- Verification is bounded by delivered build evidence: these flows
  cannot prove an SBOM is complete beyond cross-checks against the
  manifests you provide, and cannot guarantee vulnerability absence.
- No Declaration of Conformity, CE marking decision, "compliant"
  verdict, legal product classification, or Article 14 filing. Evidence
  in, human assessment out. Preloop does not file CRA Article 14
  reports and has no client for the ENISA single reporting platform.
  The `reporting` block states a reportability *candidate* and the
  deadlines that follow from it; deciding to file, and filing, are the
  manufacturer's.
- `result.json` is persisted by the platform, and the evidence pack is
  captured as a size-capped tar.gz served by
  `GET /api/v1/flows/executions/{id}/evidence`. Long-horizon retention
  of oversized packs and artifact signing are open platform questions,
  not claimed by these presets.
- Validators / scanners are installed at run time, so the toolchain is
  not bit-for-bit fixed across runs. Every run records the exact resolved
  tool versions (`tool_versions`) and source snapshot dates
  (`db_versions`), and the payload can pin versions (e.g.
  `"tools": {"spdx-tools": "0.8.2"}`) which the prompt honors. Shipping
  pinned tools in the runner image is the stronger fix; what it would
  cost, and which tool, is measured in
  [Scanner binaries in the agent image](scanner-binaries-decision.md).
  For vulnerability results, database churn, not tool
  versions, is the dominant source of run-to-run variance, which is why
  snapshot dates are always recorded.
- These presets verify SBOMs. They never generate one. SBOM creation
  belongs to the build toolchain (Yocto / OpenEmbedded `create-spdx`,
  AOSP SBOM tooling, CycloneDX build plugins). If no SBOM was
  delivered, the run errors rather than inventing one. Scoped to one
  project inside a repository, the same limit reads as
  `scope.status: "not_checkable"` with its reason: no manifest
  fallback, no neighbour's SBOM, and no passing verdict. Whether an agent
  image should carry a generator at all, and what the claim would become
  if it did, is decided in
  [Scanner binaries in the agent image](scanner-binaries-decision.md).

## Vulnerability sources (honest notes)

- **OSV.dev** is the primary source: `POST https://api.osv.dev/v1/querybatch`
  with purl or name+ecosystem+version, no API key required. Results record
  `osv_queried_at`. Query form matters: one component per query object;
  strip purl qualifiers; Maven is `group:artifact` with a colon. A
  malformed query returns an empty set that looks like a clean
  component, which is why each source has a negative control.
- **CISA KEV** catalog supplies known-exploited flags; the catalog
  release date is recorded as `kev_snapshot_date`. If cisa.gov returns
  403, the release-audit prompt falls back to the official
  `cisagov/kev-data` GitHub mirror and records the URL actually used. A
  failed primary fetch is not "zero KEV hits". KEV hits appear in
  `art14_candidates` as a prioritisation signal for a human, not legal
  advice, and Preloop does not file Article 14 reports.
- **EPSS** scores are best-effort (`api.first.org`); `null` when
  unreachable.
- **NVD** is a fallback only: the public API without a key is
  rate-limited to roughly 5 requests per 30 seconds, so runs do not
  enumerate NVD for a whole SBOM. How (and whether) NVD was used is
  recorded in `db_versions.nvd`. NVD CPE name+version search is a
  **labeled heuristic**, never presented as a database match.
- Components without a version or a purl / CPE identifier cannot be
  reliably matched; they are counted as `unmatchable` and results
  never claim vulnerability absence for them.
- The Release Security Audit additionally reports `db_resolvable`
  coverage (components in ecosystems the advisory databases actually
  index; `pkg:generic` and `pkg:github` are not db-resolvable by purl)
  and runs a mandatory negative control: a known-vulnerable component
  queried in the same style as the inventory. If the control comes back
  empty the method is blind for that class (`method_blind: true`) and
  those components are reported as "not screenable by this method",
  never as "zero vulnerabilities".
- If the sandbox has no egress to these sources, the run reports an
  error rather than fabricating findings or their absence.

```

In product mode the Release Security Audit additionally copies
`result.json` and `evidence/` into the compliance repo and writes
per-repo stubs. See
[Evidence storage architecture](#evidence-storage-architecture-multi-repo-products).

## Evidence storage architecture (multi-repo products)

Authorities and auditors think in **products**, but a product usually
spans several code repositories (firmware, companion app, cloud
backend). Preloop flows already attach any number of git repositories
(`git_clone_config.repositories[]`, each with its own `clone_path`), and
the Release Security Audit preset uses that to store evidence in a
**hybrid** layout:

1. **Per-repo stub.** Each audited code repo receives one small
   (< 2 KB), diffable, dated file at
   `.preloop/evidence/<UTC timestamp>-release-security-audit.json`
   (`preloop.cra.repostub/v1`): run date, verdict, gate outcome,
   severity counts, the repo's own HEAD commit SHA, and a pointer to the
   product-level pack. It rides the same PR discipline as code, so the
   evidence trail is tamper-evident with the code history, and it
   deliberately carries **no findings detail**, so code repos never
   accrue artifact bloat.
2. **Product-level compliance repo.** One dedicated repository per
   product receives the full pack under
   `products/<product>/audits/<UTC timestamp>-<release_ref>/`: a copy of
   `result.json`, the whole `evidence/` directory, and a
   `manifest.json` (`preloop.cra.evidencepack/v1`) listing every
   constituent code repo with its remote and **HEAD commit SHA**. The
   manifest SHAs and the stub SHAs must agree. That cross-reference is
   the spine of the audit trail.

Why hybrid, rather than everything in the code repos or everything in a
database:

- **Authorities think product-level.** One repo answers "show me the
  evidence for this product", across firmware / app / cloud, in one
  place.
- **Access control.** Auditors and legal can be granted the compliance
  repo without any source access.
- **Retention outlives repo churn.** CRA-style retention runs for years
  after release; code repos get renamed, split, and archived. The
  compliance repo persists, and its records reference code repos by
  commit SHA, which survives renames.
- **No artifact bloat in code repos**, while each repo still carries a
  tamper-evident, diffable trace of every audit that covered it.

### Configuring product mode

Clone the Release Security Audit preset into a flow and attach the
product's repositories plus the compliance repo. The flow config names
the compliance repo by the `clone_path: compliance` convention (a
payload field `compliance_repo_path` can override the path per run):

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "repositories": [
    {
      "repository_url": "https://git.example.com/example-product/firmware.git",
      "clone_path": "firmware"
    },
    {
      "repository_url": "https://git.example.com/example-product/companion-app.git",
      "clone_path": "companion-app"
    },
    {
      "repository_url": "https://git.example.com/example-product/product-compliance.git",
      "clone_path": "compliance"
    }
  ],
  "create_pull_request": true
}
```

The agent writes the stubs and the pack and **commits locally** on the
branch the platform prepared; pushing and PR / MR creation happen in the
platform's post-execution step, per repository, gated by this flow
config. The agent never runs `git push`. With no repositories attached
the phase is skipped and the preset behaves exactly as before
(artifact-only); `result.json` stays `preloop.cra.releaseaudit/v1` and
gains only an additive, nullable `evidence_storage` section describing
what was written where and whether each commit succeeded.

### The same pattern for SBOM Verify and Exploit Check (spec)

The standalone presets remain artifact-only for now. When they adopt
product mode they will follow the identical pattern, changing only the
flow slug in the stub filename
(`…-sbom-verify.json` / `…-sbom-exploit-check.json`), the `result_schema`
field, and the pack directory (`products/<product>/audits/…` with the
per-preset artifact set). The compliance-repo convention
(`clone_path: compliance`), the stub / manifest schemas
(`preloop.cra.repostub/v1`, `preloop.cra.evidencepack/v1`), the SHA
cross-reference rule, and the commit discipline are shared: one storage
architecture, three producers.

### Honest limits of the storage design

- Tamper evidence comes from git history (and whatever branch
  protection / signing you enforce on the compliance repo). Records are
  not independently signed or timestamped by Preloop.
- The SHA cross-reference proves which code the audit *saw checked
  out*; it does not prove the delivered SBOM was built from those SHAs.
  That link is only as strong as the build metadata your CI delivers.
- Retention is your repo's retention: the design assumes you keep the
  compliance repo for the support period; Preloop does not enforce it.

## Component Due Diligence Record

CRA-style due diligence applies to **every integrated component**,
commercial and open source, and the decisions must be *stored*, not
just made: expect to answer how you decided a component was appropriate,
what documentation you checked, and what was known at the time. This
preset splits the work honestly:

- **Agent legwork (facts, sources cited):** documentation actually
  delivered or fetched; CVE history via OSV.dev with CISA KEV
  cross-check; maintenance signals (release cadence, activity,
  deprecation notices) from cited public sources; **presence** of a
  supplier CE declaration document (never its authenticity:
  `authenticity_verified` is always `false`); declared license; and an
  explicit *open unknowns* list.
- **Human risk decision:** the agent calls the builtin
  `request_approval` tool once with a neutral dossier summary. It never
  recommends an outcome. Approval granted → `accepted`, denied →
  `rejected`, tool unavailable → `pending` (and the run reports
  `error`). Reviewer identity and the decision timestamp live in
  Preloop's approval audit trail; the record references the approval
  and never invents a name.
- **Stored record:** `result.json` (`preloop.cra.duediligence/v1`)
  plus, when the flow attaches a compliance repo (same
  `clone_path: compliance` convention), a dated pair committed under
  `products/<product>/components/<component>/`:
  `<UTC timestamp>-due-diligence.json` and the human-readable dossier
  beside it.
