# Cursor, Claude Desktop & Other MCP Clients

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

After this page you know exactly what Preloop can and cannot govern for each MCP-capable client the CLI discovers, and how to wire the ones that need manual steps.

Any client that speaks MCP over streamable HTTP can point at Preloop's endpoint with an API key:

```text
URL:    https://YOUR_PRELOOP_URL/mcp/v1
Header: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

That gives you the MCP firewall (access rules, approvals, audit) for every tool call the client makes through Preloop. What differs per client is **model traffic**: only some clients let Preloop rewrite their model configuration so spend flows through the [gateway](../concepts/model-gateway.md).

## Support matrix

| Client | Tool governance (MCP) | Model routing through the gateway |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| [Claude Code](claude-code.md) | Automatic | Automatic |
| [Codex CLI](../codex-cli.md) | Automatic | Automatic |
| [Gemini CLI](gemini-cli.md) | Automatic | Automatic |
| [OpenCode](opencode.md) | Automatic | Automatic |
| [Hermes](../hermes.md) | Automatic | Automatic |
| [OpenClaw](../integrations/openclaw.md) | Automatic | Automatic (OpenAI-compatible gateway) |
| Cursor | Automatic | **Manual BYOK**: AI panel incl. Agent mode (see below) |
| Claude Desktop | Automatic | Not available |
| Windsurf | Automatic | Not available |
| VS Code / Copilot | Automatic | Not available |
| Copilot CLI | Automatic (`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`) | Not rewritten on onboard. `preloop copilot` sets the gateway env vars |
| Antigravity | Automatic | Not available: locked to Google-hosted models, no custom base URL |
| Devin | Automatic | Not available: inference runs in Cognition's cloud |

"Automatic" means `preloop agents discover` / `preloop agents onboard <agent>` handles it. Clients without model routing keep using their own provider credentials: tool calls are governed and audited, but their model spend is not metered live, so model budgets do not apply to them. Spend that is not metered live can still be brought into Cost analytics after the fact by importing it, see [Importing usage from Cursor](../cost/importing-cursor-usage.md).

## Cursor

Onboarding configures the MCP firewall automatically. Model routing is a manual BYOK step because Cursor only accepts a custom model base URL through its in-app **Settings → Models** (global, no config-file hook), so Preloop cannot rewrite it for you. Once set, the override covers more than chat: Cursor's AI panel routes third-party model calls through the gateway in Ask/Plan mode **and** in Agent mode.

Cursor's **bundled models** (Composer, Auto) are a separate case: they are billed and served by Cursor and cannot be pointed at any custom endpoint, so no configuration will ever route them through the gateway. That spend is not invisible, though. Export it from the Cursor dashboard and import it:

```bash
preloop agents onboard cursor        # once, so imports have an agent to attribute to
preloop usage import cursor-usage.csv
```

Imported records show up in Cost analytics as their own block, labeled as imported and kept out of gateway budgets, so metered and imported spend stay separately auditable. Re-importing the same export is safe. See [Importing usage from Cursor](../cost/importing-cursor-usage.md) for the full walkthrough, including the API endpoints and custom column mapping.

Cursor is also one of the clients that supports the native tool-approval hook: `preloop agents onboard cursor --approvals` routes tool calls that would have prompted you locally to Preloop approvals instead.

### Route Cursor model traffic through Preloop

Cursor's AI panel, in Ask/Plan mode and Agent mode, can send its model calls through the Preloop gateway. Tab autocomplete, inline edit (Cmd/Ctrl+K), and Cursor's own bundled models (Composer, Grok, Auto) always use Cursor's backend and cannot be routed through any external gateway, ours or anyone else's.

Prerequisites:

- A Preloop API key. Mint one scoped to Cursor: subject-scoped allowed-model lists apply to gateway calls made with it.
- Your Preloop gateway URL must be reachable over public HTTPS. Cursor relays BYOK requests from its own servers, so a localhost or LAN-only Preloop cannot receive them; Cursor blocks localhost base URLs outright.

Steps:

1. Open Cursor Settings, then go to **Models**.
2. In the **OpenAI API Key** section, paste your Preloop API key and enable the key toggle.
3. Enable **Override OpenAI Base URL** and enter `https://YOUR_PRELOOP_URL/openai/v1`.
4. Pick a third-party model in the model picker (for example `gpt-5.2` or `claude-sonnet-4-5`), or use **Add Custom Model** with the exact model alias configured on your Preloop AI models.
5. Test: open the AI panel (Cmd/Ctrl+L), send a prompt, then check **Cost** and **Audit > Sessions** in the Preloop console for the call.

What to expect:

- Requests arrive at `POST /openai/v1/chat/completions` with your Preloop key as a bearer token. Budgets, allowed-model lists, usage recording, and replay all apply.
- Claude and Gemini models work through this same path. Cursor's Anthropic key slot has no base-URL override (it always targets Anthropic directly), but Preloop's OpenAI-compatible endpoint resolves any gateway-enabled account model by alias, so add your Claude alias as a custom model and serve it through `/openai/v1`.
- Selecting Composer, Grok, or another Cursor-billed bundled model while the override is enabled fails with "This model does not support custom API keys". Switching to Auto works but silently bypasses the override; bundled-model spend never reaches Preloop, for any gateway vendor.
- Privacy note: Cursor still relays these requests through its own backend for prompt assembly, and Cursor's Zero Data Retention does not apply to custom-key traffic.
- On Cursor Teams and Enterprise plans, BYOK requests additionally consume Cursor's Token Rate ($0.25 per million tokens) on the Cursor side; that residue does not appear in Preloop Cost analytics. Enterprise admins can also restrict personal API keys entirely, which blocks this override pattern on managed teams.

## Copilot CLI

`preloop agents onboard "Copilot CLI"` backs up `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json` and adds the Preloop MCP server (`/mcp/v1`). The CLI does not read VS Code's `.vscode/mcp.json`. Onboarding does not rewrite model traffic. `preloop copilot` starts the `copilot` binary with `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` pointed at the Preloop gateway. IDE Copilot chat and inline completions are a different client (VS Code / Copilot, above) and are not covered by that launcher.

## Claude Desktop

Discovered and onboarded for MCP governance. Claude Desktop has no mechanism for custom model endpoints, so model routing is not available.

## Everything else

If your client is MCP-capable but not in the table, add the endpoint manually (URL + bearer header as above) and it gets the same tool governance. Check `preloop agents discover --json` first: the discovery list grows release by release.
