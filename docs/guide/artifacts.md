# Session artifacts

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

An artifact is a file an agent produced or captured during a runtime session:
a screenshot, a call transcript, a summary document, a generated report, a
Playwright trace. Preloop stores it encrypted on the session, records an
`artifact` row on the session timeline, and serves the bytes back to anyone in
the account who may read runtime sessions.

An artifact is evidence of what the agent said it produced. Storing one is not
an approval and does not prove the content is correct.

## Kinds and caps

Every artifact has a kind. The kind fixes the media types it accepts and the
largest size it may have. For most media types the first bytes are compared
with the format signature, so a file that is not the declared type is refused.

| Kind | Media types | Default cap | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `screenshot` | `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp` | 2 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_SCREENSHOT_MAX_BYTES` |
| `recording` | `video/webm`, `video/mp4` | 512 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_RECORDING_MAX_BYTES` |
| `screencast` | `video/webm`, `video/mp4` | 64 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_SCREENCAST_MAX_BYTES` |
| `audio` | `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/ogg`, `audio/webm`, `audio/mp4`, `audio/flac` | 25 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_AUDIO_MAX_BYTES` |
| `transcript` | `text/plain`, `text/vtt`, `application/x-subrip`, `application/json` | 5 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_TRANSCRIPT_MAX_BYTES` |
| `document` | `text/plain`, `text/markdown`, `application/json`, `application/pdf` | 10 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_DOCUMENT_MAX_BYTES` |
| `generated_file` | any type except native executables (ELF, PE, Mach-O) | 10 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_GENERATED_FILE_MAX_BYTES` |
| `trace` | `application/zip` (for example a Playwright `trace.zip`) | 25 MiB | `RUNTIME_SESSION_TRACE_MAX_BYTES` |

When a deposit names no kind, Preloop infers one from the content: an image is
a `screenshot`, audio is `audio`, video is a `recording`, `text/vtt` and
`application/x-subrip` are a `transcript`, other text is a `document`, and
anything else is a `generated_file`. If the inferred kind does not accept the
media type (for example `image/gif` or `text/csv`), the deposit is stored as a
`generated_file` instead of being refused. Audio is the exception: it stays
`audio`, so the account's audio setting still applies.

A request body may be at most the largest kind cap plus 1 MiB. Larger bodies
are refused before they are parsed.

## Labels

Labels are a small JSON object you attach at deposit time and filter by later.
At most 16 keys; each key matches `^[a-z][a-z0-9_.-]{0,62}$`; each value is a
string of up to 128 characters, except `tags`, which is a list of up to 16
such strings. These keys are reserved and have a documented meaning:

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `site` | Physical or logical site the artifact belongs to, for example a plant. |
| `tenant_ref` | Your own customer or tenant reference. |
| `consent_basis` | Why recording this person is allowed, for example `contract`. |
| `retention_class` | Retention bucket name, enforced by the Enterprise records policy. |
| `tags` | Free-form list of short strings. |

Any other key that follows the rules is stored as given. A label that breaks a
rule refuses the whole deposit with `artifact_labels_invalid`.

## Depositing an artifact

All three paths store through the same service, write the same timeline row
and return the same error codes. The session always comes from the
credential: an agent can only deposit on its own session.

### Get a session-bound key

The examples below use a runtime session token. A console user (or a launcher
acting for one) mints it:

```bash
curl -X POST "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/auth/runtime-sessions/token" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_source_type": "claude_code",
    "session_source_id": "docs-demo-4",
    "expires_in_minutes": 60,
    "allowed_mcp_tools": ["deposit_artifact"]
  }'
```

```json
{"runtime_session_id":"a30cd80e-...","token":"flow_vJlp...","expires_at":"2026-10-01T17:07:22Z","session_source_type":"claude_code","session_source_id":"docs-demo-4","session_reference":null}
```

Use `runtime_session_id` as `$SESSION_ID` and `token` as `$AGENT_KEY`. A
managed agent key that is pinned to a session works the same way.

### 1. MCP tool `deposit_artifact`

`deposit_artifact` is a built-in MCP tool, **off by default**. Turn it on for
the account on the **Tools** page, or list it in a flow's `allowed_mcp_tools`.
A session token keeps only the tools the account had enabled when it was
minted, so mint (or re-mint) the token after enabling the tool and ask for it
in `allowed_mcp_tools` as above.

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http preloop https://preloop.example.com/mcp/v1 \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_KEY"
```

opencode, in `opencode.json` (project) or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "preloop": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://preloop.example.com/mcp/v1",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {env:AGENT_KEY}" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask the agent to save its work, or call the tool directly. The arguments
are one MCP `ContentBlock` plus a name, an optional kind and labels:

```json
{
  "name": "deposit_artifact",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "notes.md",
    "kind": "document",
    "labels": {"site": "heilbronn"},
    "content": {"type": "text", "text": "# Notes\nRestarted line 3."}
  }
}
```

`content.type` is `text`, `image` (`data`, `mimeType`), `audio` (`data`,
`mimeType`), `resource` (`resource.uri`, `resource.mimeType`, and `text` or
base64 `blob`), or `resource_link` to an artifact of the same session, which
stores a copy with new labels as a child of the linked one. The result has one
`resource_link` content block pointing at the stored bytes and the full
artifact descriptor as `structuredContent`:

```json
{"content":[{"type":"resource_link","name":"notes.md","uri":"http://localhost:18090/api/v1/runtime-sessions/a30cd80e-.../artifacts/88b4b89d-...","mimeType":"text/plain","size":25,"_meta":{"preloop.dev/artifact":{"artifact_id":"88b4b89d-...","kind":"document","labels":{"site":"heilbronn"},"sha256":"129f22f5...","producer":"deposit_mcp"}}}],"structuredContent":{"id":"88b4b89d-...","kind":"document","availability":"available","...":"..."}}
```

Refusals are tool errors whose text starts with the error code.

### 2. REST

`POST /api/v1/runtime-sessions/{runtime_session_id}/artifacts` with the agent
key. The response is `201` with the artifact descriptor.

JSON, with the content as an MCP `ContentBlock`:

```bash
curl -X POST "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/runtime-sessions/$SESSION_ID/artifacts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: call-42-vtt" \
  -d "{
    \"name\": \"call.vtt\",
    \"labels\": {\"consent_basis\": \"contract\"},
    \"content\": {
      \"type\": \"resource\",
      \"resource\": {
        \"uri\": \"file:///call.vtt\",
        \"mimeType\": \"text/vtt\",
        \"blob\": \"$(base64 < call.vtt | tr -d '\n')\"
      }
    }
  }"
```

```json
{"id":"5898d690-...","runtime_session_id":"5e25eed1-...","activity_id":"ea2154a4-...","kind":"transcript","name":"call.vtt","content_type":"text/vtt","size_bytes":67,"sha256":"dfd59948...","labels":{"consent_basis":"contract"},"producer":"deposit_api","agent_id":"7deec1ef-...","tool_name":null,"parent_artifact_id":null,"text_status":"none","availability":"available","legal_hold":false,"created_at":"2026-10-01T16:06:48.135281Z","content_block":{"type":"resource_link","uri":"/api/v1/runtime-sessions/5e25eed1-.../artifacts/5898d690-...","name":"call.vtt","mimeType":"text/vtt","size":67,"_meta":{"preloop.dev/artifact":{"artifact_id":"5898d690-...","kind":"transcript","labels":{"consent_basis":"contract"},"sha256":"dfd59948...","producer":"deposit_api"}}}}
```

The optional `Idempotency-Key` header makes a retry safe: the same key on the
same session returns the original artifact with `201` and the header
`Idempotent-Replayed: true`, and stores nothing new.

A plain text body is the shortest form:

```bash
curl -X POST "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/runtime-sessions/$SESSION_ID/artifacts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "call-summary.md", "kind": "document",
       "labels": {"site": "heilbronn", "tags": ["shift-a"]},
       "content": {"type": "text", "text": "# Summary\n\nLine 3 stopped at 06:10."}}'
```

Multipart, for files on disk. The `file` part carries the bytes and its media
type; the optional `metadata` part is the same fields as JSON, without
`content`. `name` defaults to the file name:

```bash
curl -X POST "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/runtime-sessions/$SESSION_ID/artifacts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_KEY" \
  -F "file=@call.vtt;type=text/vtt" \
  -F 'metadata={"kind":"transcript","labels":{"site":"heilbronn"}}'
```

Optional fields in both encodings: `activity_id` (a timeline row of this
session the artifact illustrates), `parent_artifact_id` (an artifact of this
account it derives from, for example a summary of a transcript) and
`tool_name`.

List a session's artifacts, newest first, with the agent key or a console
user token:

```bash
curl "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/runtime-sessions/$SESSION_ID/artifacts?kind=transcript&label=site:heilbronn&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN"
```

```json
{"items":[{"id":"65cd256c-...","kind":"transcript","name":"call.vtt","labels":{"site":"heilbronn"},"availability":"available","...":"..."}],"next_cursor":null}
```

`label` is repeatable (`key:value`), `limit` is 1 to 200 (default 50), and
`next_cursor` goes into `cursor` for the next page.

Read the bytes with the `content_block.uri`:

```bash
curl "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/runtime-sessions/$SESSION_ID/artifacts/$ARTIFACT_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN"
```

The response has the stored media type and `Cache-Control: private,
max-age=300`. It is 410 with `{"availability": "evicted"}` or
`{"availability": "expired"}` once the bytes are gone.

The full request and response schemas are in the API reference
(`openapi.yaml`, operation `deposit_runtime_session_artifact`).

### 3. CLI

```bash
preloop artifacts put standup.vtt --session <id> --label site=nord
some-tool | preloop artifacts put - --session <id> --content-type text/plain --name notes.txt
preloop artifacts ls --session <id> --kind transcript --since 7d
preloop artifacts get <artifact-id> --session <id> -o standup.vtt
```

`put` streams the multipart call above and prints the artifact id and a
console link. `--json` prints the descriptor unchanged. See
[CLI: Artifacts](cli.md#artifacts) for every flag.

## Reading artifacts from an agent

Two built-in MCP tools, both **off by default**, let an agent find and read
artifacts: `search_artifacts` and `get_artifact`. Enable them on the **Tools**
page or list them in a flow's `allowed_mcp_tools`.

```json
{
  "name": "search_artifacts",
  "arguments": {
    "kind": ["transcript"],
    "labels": {"site": "heilbronn"},
    "since": "2026-10-04T08:00:00+00:00",
    "until": "2026-10-04T09:00:00+00:00"
  }
}
```

- `q` matches the artifact's extracted text (web search syntax) or its name.
- `kind` is a list; `labels` must all match; a label with an empty value
  matches any.
- `since` is inclusive and `until` exclusive, both on `created_at`, ISO 8601
  with an offset. A scheduled flow can pass its own
  `trigger_event.payload.window.from` / `.to`.
- `limit` is at most 50; pass `next_cursor` back as `cursor` for the next page.

The answer is `structuredContent.items` (each artifact's descriptor plus
`excerpt`, a short fragment of its text with matches in `**bold**`), the same
JSON as the first `text` block (MCP clients that show only text, such as
OpenCode, read that), then one `resource_link` block per artifact.

`get_artifact {artifact_id, max_bytes?}` returns the descriptor as a leading
`text` block, then the content: an
`EmbeddedResource` with `text` for text kinds (the first `max_bytes`, default
64 KiB, with `_meta["preloop.dev/artifact"].truncated` set when cut), inline
bytes for binaries up to 1 MiB, and a `resource_link` beyond that.

**Scope.** By default both tools see only artifacts of sessions run by the
calling agent identity, across all its runs. For a flow the identity is the
flow: a run sees the artifacts of every run of the same flow, not of other
flows. `scope: "account"` reads every
artifact of the account and needs the `artifact_search.account_scope` grant
for that agent (granted through the Enterprise Edition governance settings).
Without the grant the call is refused with `account_scope_not_granted`, naming
the grant; it is never quietly narrowed. `get_artifact` answers an id outside
the caller's scope with `artifact_not_found`. Every call, answered or refused,
is written to the audit log with the agent as the actor.

## Where artifacts appear

- **Session timeline.** Every deposit writes an `artifact` row on the session
  timeline, in time order between the model turns and tool calls around it.
  The console renders these rows with a kind icon, the name, labels, a text
  excerpt or thumbnail, and a header count with a filter per kind (#1083).
  A session without artifacts says so in the header and links to this page.
- **Activity API.** `GET /api/v1/runtime-sessions/{id}/activity` returns the
  same `artifact` rows with an artifact summary in `metadata.artifact`: `id`,
  `kind`, `name`, `content_type`, `size_bytes`, `labels` and `producer`. The
  full descriptor (`sha256`, `availability`, `legal_hold`,
  `parent_artifact_id` and so on) comes from
  `GET /api/v1/runtime-sessions/{id}/artifacts`.
- **Artifacts page.** **Audit > Artifacts** (`/console/artifacts`) lists the
  artifacts of every session with search, kind, site, label, agent, tool,
  date and legal hold filters, and a gallery for screenshots. Filters live in
  the URL, so a filtered view can be shared. A row opens its session on the
  artifact's timeline row.
- **Storage card.** **Settings > Account** shows the session artifact storage
  used per kind against the account budget. **Browse artifacts** and each
  kind's name open the Artifacts page, filtered to that kind.
- **Account search.** `GET /api/v1/artifacts` searches every session of the
  account; see [Searching across sessions](#searching-across-sessions).

Browser step screenshots are artifacts of kind `screenshot` too; see
[Browser steps](browser-agents.md) for how the console shows them.

## Searching across sessions

`GET /api/v1/artifacts` lists the account's artifacts from every session,
newest first. It needs a user with `view_runtime_sessions`. All parameters are optional and combine with AND:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `q` | Full text over the artifact's indexed text (transcripts, documents, and the name, labels and tool of every kind), or a substring of the name. |
| `kind` | Repeatable; any of the listed kinds. |
| `label` | Repeatable `key:value`; every value must match (`site:a&label=site:b` matches nothing). `tags:x` matches one tag of the list. |
| `agent_id`, `tool_name`, `producer`, `runtime_session_id` | Exact match. |
| `from`, `to` | ISO 8601 on `created_at`; `from` inclusive, `to` exclusive. |
| `held` | `true` for artifacts under legal hold, `false` for the rest. |
| `availability` | `available`, `evicted` or `expired`. |
| `limit`, `cursor` | Same paging as the per-session list. |

Each item is the session list descriptor plus `session_title` and
`agent_name`. With `q`, a matching text chunk adds `excerpt` (`text`, already
redacted when it was indexed, and `highlights`, a list of `[start, end)`
character offsets of the hits) and, for transcripts, `cue_start` in seconds.
Results stay in time order when `q` is set, so a cursor stays valid while new
artifacts arrive.

`facets.kind` and `facets.site` count kinds and `labels.site` values over the
whole filter (not one page). Past 10000 matching rows the counts cover the
newest 10000 and `facets_truncated` is `true`.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $PRELOOP_TOKEN" \
  "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/artifacts?q=damaged%20pallet&kind=transcript&label=site:nord&from=2026-09-27T00:00:00Z"
```

## Retention, legal hold, budget and eviction

- **Budget.** Each account has one plaintext budget for all session artifacts,
  `RUNTIME_SESSION_ARTIFACT_ACCOUNT_MAX_BYTES` (5 GiB by default; no
  per-account override yet). A deposit that does not fit evicts the oldest
  unheld artifacts first: recordings, then the other media kinds
  (screenshots, screencasts, audio, generated files, traces), then
  transcripts and documents last, because they are small and are what a
  reviewer searches. An evicted artifact keeps its row, name, labels and
  sha256; only the bytes go, and `availability` becomes `evicted`. When even
  eviction cannot make room the deposit is refused with
  `storage_budget_exhausted`.
- **Screenshots per session.** Browser step screenshots are also bounded per
  session (`RUNTIME_SESSION_SCREENSHOTS_PER_SESSION_MAX`, 500).
- **Legal hold.** An artifact copies the legal hold flag of its session when it
  is stored, and `legal_hold` is in the descriptor. Held artifacts are never
  evicted and never purged.
- **Retention.** Artifacts belong to their session. When the retention purge
  (off by default, `RETENTION_PURGE_ENABLED`) removes a session, its unheld
  artifacts go with it. Bytes removed by a retention policy answer 410 with
  `availability: expired`.

## Audio is off by default

Audio of people is personal data in most jurisdictions. Every `audio` deposit,
and any deposit whose media type is `audio/*` whatever its declared kind, is
refused with `409 artifact_audio_storage_disabled` unless an account admin
opts in. Transcripts are stored either way: store the transcript with a
`consent_basis` label.

To opt in, open **Settings > Account > Session artifact storage** and turn on
**Store raw audio**, or call
`PUT /api/v1/account/session-artifacts/settings` with
`{"audio_storage_enabled": true}`. The change needs the `manage_policies`
permission and writes an `artifact_settings_updated` audit row with who
changed which field from what to what, and when. A request that changes
nothing writes no row.

`audio_retention_days` (default 30, at most the runtime-session retention)
bounds how long raw audio is kept. The
[audio transcription agent](flows/audio-transcription-agent.md) preset shows
the whole loop. The artifact janitor expires older audio:
its bytes are dropped, the row stays, and the byte route answers
`410 {"availability": "expired"}`. Audio under a legal hold is kept.

## Standards mapping

Preloop does not invent a content shape. Ingest and tool results are MCP
`ContentBlock`s; export maps to A2A and OpenTelemetry GenAI. Preloop fields
that a standard has no slot for travel in its extension point. The mapping
code is `backend/preloop/services/artifact_shapes.py`.

| Preloop | MCP `ContentBlock` (spec 2026-07-28) | A2A v1.0.1 | OTel GenAI parts (Development) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| text content | `TextContent {type:"text", text}` | `Part {text}` | `BlobPart` with `modality: document` |
| image bytes | `ImageContent {type:"image", data, mimeType}` | `Part {raw, filename, media_type}` | `BlobPart {type:"blob", mime_type, modality:"image", content}` |
| audio bytes | `AudioContent {type:"audio", data, mimeType}` | `Part {raw, filename, media_type}` | `BlobPart` with `modality: audio` |
| any file bytes | `EmbeddedResource {type:"resource", resource:{uri, mimeType, text or blob}}` | `Part {raw, filename, media_type}` | `BlobPart` |
| stored artifact by reference | `ResourceLink {type:"resource_link", uri, name, mimeType, size}` | `Part {url, filename, media_type}` | `UriPart {type:"uri", mime_type, modality, uri}` (preferred for export) |
| JSON segments | `TextContent` or `EmbeddedResource` with `application/json` | `Part {data}` | `BlobPart` with `modality: document` |
| artifact envelope | one block | `Artifact {artifact_id, name, parts[], metadata}` | one part |
| `artifact_id`, `kind`, `labels`, `sha256`, `producer` | `_meta["preloop.dev/artifact"]` | `metadata["preloop.dev/artifact"]` | span attributes `preloop.artifact.kind`, `preloop.artifact.labels` |

Kind to OTel `modality`: `screenshot` is `image`; `recording` and `screencast`
are `video`; `audio` is `audio`; `transcript`, `document`, `generated_file`
and `trace` are `document`. Converting an artifact to any of the three shapes
and back keeps its media type, byte sha256, name, kind and labels.

## Error codes

The REST API returns `{"detail": "<code>"}`; the MCP tool returns a tool error
whose text starts with the code.

| HTTP | Code | Meaning |

| 507 | `storage_budget_exhausted` | The account budget cannot fit the artifact even after eviction. |
| (MCP) | `artifact_no_session` | The MCP credential is not bound to a runtime session. |
| (MCP) | `artifact_link_outside_session` | A `resource_link` names an artifact of another session. |
| (MCP) 410 | `artifact_unavailable` | A `resource_link` names an artifact whose bytes were evicted or deleted. |
