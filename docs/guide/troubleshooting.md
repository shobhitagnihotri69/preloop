# Troubleshooting

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

After this page you can diagnose the failures people actually hit: the OSS installer refusing to start, agents that onboard but stay "unverified", WSL discovery misses, locked-out registration, and MCP connections that silently show no tools.

## Installer

### "Docker is not installed" / daemon errors

The installer probes Docker before doing anything. The three messages and what they mean:

- `Docker is not installed (the 'docker' command was not found).`: install Docker Desktop (macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux) first.
- `Docker is installed but the daemon is not running.`: start it with `open -a Docker` on macOS, `sudo systemctl start docker` on Linux.
- `Docker is installed but its daemon did not respond within 10 seconds.`: the daemon is wedged. Restart it (`killall Docker && open -a Docker`, or `sudo systemctl restart docker`) and verify with `docker info`.

`Docker Compose v2 is required` means the `docker compose` subcommand failed: upgrade Docker or install the compose plugin.

### The install ran but something is off

Everything the installer did is in `~/.preloop-oss/install.log`. On a compose failure the installer prints the last 15 lines automatically; read the full log before retrying.

### Admin email rejected at the prompt

The installer validates the admin email up front (`name@domain.tld` shape) so first-user creation cannot fail at the very end. Interactive installs re-prompt (type `skip` to leave signups open instead); unattended installs fail fast with `PRELOOP_ADMIN_EMAIL must be a plausible address` before touching anything.

### "FIRST USER WAS NOT CREATED" banner

If unattended first-user creation fails, the installer exits non-zero with a loud banner, and deliberately leaves public signups **open** so you are not locked out. Create the first user in the console using the **setup link** the banner prints (`<PRELOOP_URL>/register#bootstrap=<token>`, while the instance has zero users, registration requires that token), then re-run the installer (or set `REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false` in `~/.preloop-oss/.env` and `docker compose up -d api`) to close registration.

### Registration is closed but the database is fresh

Re-running the installer against a fresh database (for example after deleting the postgres volume) while `.env` still says `REGISTRATION_ENABLED=false` would lock everyone out. The installer detects this, it counts users in the database and prints:

```text
The existing configuration disables public signup, but the database is fresh
(no users): re-enabling registration so the first user can sign up.
```

If you hit a closed `/register` on an instance you know is empty, re-run the installer or flip `REGISTRATION_ENABLED=true` in `.env` yourself and restart the api service.

Note that on an empty instance with `PRELOOP_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` set in `.env` (every installer-managed install), `/register` shows a **"Setup link required"** notice instead of the open form: the first signup must use the setup link (`<PRELOOP_URL>/register#bootstrap=<token>`), regardless of `REGISTRATION_ENABLED`. Rebuild the link from the token in `~/.preloop-oss/.env`, or re-run the installer to have it printed again. A **"This instance has already been claimed"** notice on the setup link means a user already exists: sign in instead, or ask the admin for an invitation.

## CLI and onboarding

### An agent shows `partial` in the onboarding summary

`partial` is not an error. It means MCP and model routing were configured but the managed launcher step was skipped, almost always because the agent binary is not on `PATH`:

```text
codex binary not found in PATH - launcher skipped; MCP and model routing configured
```

Install the binary (or fix `PATH`) and re-run `preloop agents onboard <agent>`.

### WSL: discovery finds nothing / everything is `partial`

Agents installed on the Windows side are not on the WSL `PATH`. The CLI prints this hint when it detects WSL:

```text
Running under WSL: agents installed on Windows are not on the WSL PATH - install the agent inside WSL or add its Windows install dir to PATH.
```

Prefer installing the agents inside WSL; mixing Windows binaries with a WSL-side Preloop CLI leaves the launcher step permanently skipped.

For Docker Desktop setup, the native Windows CLI binaries, and the current
Windows limitations, see [Windows](../operations/windows-wsl2.md).

### Agent has an "unverified" badge in the console

Onboarding sends a direct gateway route/accounting probe using managed configuration. It does not launch the application or prove that application traffic uses the gateway. Two outcomes leave the agent enrolled without successful probe evidence:

- **Live check throttled**: the provider rate-limited the verification call.
- **Upstream refused**: the credential authenticated and reached the provider, but the provider rejected the call (billing/quota). This is inconclusive gateway evidence, so the configured route is retained.

Retry the direct probe with the same command in either case. Even a successful probe leaves application behavior unverified:

```bash
preloop agents validate <agent> --live
```

`preloop agents validate <agent>` (without `--live`) prints the full checklist (`preloop_server_present`, `gateway_base_url_ok`, `gateway_token_ok`, `model_provider_rewritten`, `control_*`), which pinpoints what is misconfigured.

### Rolling back an onboarding

Every onboarding backs up the original config next to it:

```bash
preloop agents restore <agent>    # put the local config back
preloop agents offboard <agent>   # restore config AND remove the managed enrollment
```

## MCP connections

### Client connects but shows no tools

The tool list is filtered per subject. Check, in order:

1. The `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header is present and the key is valid (`preloop auth status`, or curl `/api/v1/auth/api-keys` as the console user).
2. Built-in tracker tools (`get_issue`, `create_issue`, …) only appear when a tracker is connected to the account.
3. Subject-scoped governance can hide tools for a specific API key or managed agent: check the key's or agent's governance settings in the console.
4. External MCP server tools require a successful **Scan Tools** on the server entry under **Tools**.
5. A runtime-session token (`flow_...`, minted with `POST /api/v1/auth/runtime-sessions/token`) only sees the tools named when it was minted. `allowed_mcp_servers` (MCP server entry names) and `allowed_mcp_tools` (tool names) both default to empty, and an empty restriction means **no tools**, built-ins included. It is not widened to "all tools". The list is resolved at mint time: a server added or scanned later, or a name that is missing or inactive, is not included. Mint again after the change. When the restriction resolves to zero tools, the mint response carries a `warnings` entry and the managed agent's session timeline gets a `session_warning` row. The `preloop` CLI passes the servers it manages from the agent's local config, so a server added only in the console or by API needs to be named explicitly. Durable agent credentials (`agt_...`) are not restricted this way.

```bash
curl -X POST "$PRELOOP_URL/api/v1/auth/runtime-sessions/token" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_source_type": "claude_code", "session_source_id": "my-session",
       "allowed_mcp_servers": ["my-upstream-server"]}'
```

### Approval-gated calls time out

The MCP call blocks until the workflow decides, up to the workflow's `timeout_seconds` (default 300). Either raise the timeout, enable `async_approval` on the workflow so the agent polls `get_approval_status` instead of holding the connection, or make sure approvers actually get notified (SMTP configured, mobile app installed).

## Self-hosted operations

### Telemetry in test/CI environments

`PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` on the server **and** in the shell running the CLI disables the daily version check-in and all adoption telemetry. Opted-out installs never phone home and never appear in instance metrics. Set it for every disposable install, see [Upgrading Preloop](../operations/upgrade.md#disabling-telemetry-internaltest-installs).

### Where things live

| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| OSS stack install | `~/.preloop-oss/` (`docker-compose.yaml`, `.env`, `install.log`, `backups/`, `tls/`) |
| Pre-upgrade DB dumps | `~/.preloop-oss/backups/preloop-<version>-<timestamp>.sql` |
| CLI config | `~/.preloop/config.yaml` |
| Per-agent approval-hook credentials | `~/.preloop/agents/` |
| Onboarding config backups | next to each agent's own config file |
