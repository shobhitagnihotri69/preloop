# CLI Reference

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

After this page you can install the `preloop` CLI, authenticate it against Cloud or your own instance, onboard and offboard local agents, manage policies and approvals from the terminal, and read the onboarding summary table and exit codes correctly in scripts.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://preloop.ai/install/cli | sh
```

The installer downloads the release binary for your OS/arch from GitHub Releases. Useful environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `PRELOOP_VERSION` | Pin a specific release instead of the latest |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | Override the install directory |
| `PRELOOP_CONFIRM` | Truthy (`1`, `y`, `yes`, `true`, `on`): accept all prompts, for provisioning scripts, devcontainers, CI |
| `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` | `true`: no version check-ins, no conversion events, no update notices. Set this on every test or CI run |

Pre-built binaries are also on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/preloop/preloop/releases), or build from source with `make install` in `cli/`.

## Global flags and configuration

```text
--config    config file (default $HOME/.preloop/config.yaml)
--token     access token (overrides PRELOOP_TOKEN and config file)
--url       API base URL (overrides PRELOOP_URL and config file)
-v, --verbose
```

Resolution order, token: `--token` > `PRELOOP_TOKEN` > config file. URL: `--url` > `PRELOOP_URL` > config file. Point the CLI at a self-hosted instance with `preloop login --url https://preloop.example.com` once; the URL is stored in `~/.preloop/config.yaml`.

## Authentication

```bash
preloop login                # OAuth via browser (also: preloop auth login)
preloop login --headless     # copy/paste OAuth for SSH / no-GUI hosts
preloop login --token <tok>  # skip OAuth, save a token directly
preloop signup               # same flow, lands on the sign-up page
preloop auth status          # active token + API URL
preloop auth token           # print the current access token
preloop auth logout
```

`--loopback` forces the local-callback OAuth flow; `--code` resumes a previous headless login. `--loopback` and `--headless` are mutually exclusive.

## Restricted CI

```bash
preloop ci capabilities
preloop ci preview --input ci-preview.json
preloop ci create --input ci-request.json --secret-file /private/new-ci-token
preloop ci list
preloop ci show PRINCIPAL_ID
preloop ci update PRINCIPAL_ID --input change.json
preloop ci issue PRINCIPAL_ID --secret-file /private/replacement-ci-token
preloop ci rotate PRINCIPAL_ID KEY_ID --secret-file /private/rotated-ci-token
preloop ci revoke PRINCIPAL_ID KEY_ID
preloop ci subscribe PRINCIPAL_ID --input callback.json --secret-file /private/new-signing-secret
```

These commands use the saved login or `PRELOOP_TOKEN`. `--token` is rejected, so a plaintext token is not placed on the process command line. A secret is written only to a new exclusive file; stdout is safe metadata. See [Native restricted CI setup](flows/restricted-ci.md).

## Agents

```bash
preloop agents discover                  # detect local agents (read-only), then offer onboarding
preloop agents discover --json           # machine-readable, no prompts
preloop agents discover --inventory      # offline known-app inventory JSON
preloop agents discover --no-onboard-prompt
preloop agents onboard <agent>           # onboard one agent ("enroll" is an alias)
preloop agents onboard --all -y          # everything discovered, no prompts
preloop agents onboard <agent> --dry-run # preview account + config changes
preloop agents onboard <agent> --approvals  # + native action gates (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Copilot CLI, OpenCode, Pi, DeepSeek Harness)
preloop agents onboard <agent> --tags env=prod,team=infra
preloop agents status <agent>            # local + remote enrollment state
preloop agents status <agent> --json     # allowlisted status, no credentials
preloop agents list                      # managed agents in the account
preloop agents validate <agent>          # config validation
preloop agents validate <agent> --live   # + a direct gateway route/accounting probe
preloop agents reconnect "Claude Code"  # sign in and repair subscription credentials only
preloop agents reconnect "Codex CLI"    # same recovery for a ChatGPT subscription
preloop agents reconnect "Claude Code" --from-local # use a fresh login completed separately
preloop agents install-plugin <agent>    # Agent Control runtime plugin (openclaw | hermes)
preloop agents install-runtime <hermes|openclaw>  # install the runtime itself, then onboard
preloop agents restore <agent>           # restore the most recent local config backup
preloop agents offboard <agent>          # restore config + remove managed enrollment
preloop agents offboard --all -y --remove-model yes --remove-mcp-servers yes
preloop agents starter-policy <mcp-server> [-o file] [--apply]
```

`discover --json` emits only allowlisted summaries (`name`, `app_id`, `mcp_server_count`, `auth_state`, `runtime_state`). `agents status <agent> --json` reuses that agent allowlist and adds enrollment health: local apply state, remote lifecycle, validation booleans, and model credential status. It does not emit MCP env, headers, auth, config paths, tokens, or raw local or remote config. `--inventory` writes an offline `preloop.inventory.v1` envelope of known-app presence and aggregate MCP counts, with no credentials, prompts, or network calls.

Onboarding runs a direct gateway route/accounting probe by default; skip it with `--skip-live-validate`. The probe reads managed configuration but does not launch the application or verify that it consumed that configuration. Application behavior remains unverified.

`agents reconnect` preserves the existing enrollment, model bindings, policies,
gateway config and backups. It repairs a shared credential once and attaches any
legacy split model rows to it. It only updates subscription models owned by this
machine's enrollment in the selected account. Use `--from-local` after completing
`claude auth login --claudeai` or `codex login`. Expired or incomplete local
credentials are refused. Update the CLI if your installed version does not yet
provide this command.

### The onboarding summary table

Batch onboarding continues past individual failures and prints a summary:

```text
Onboarding summary:
  Agent        Status     Reason
  Claude Code  onboarded  -
  Codex CLI    partial    codex binary not found in PATH - launcher skipped; MCP and model routing configured
  Windsurf     failed     ...
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `onboarded` | Full onboarding: MCP firewall and (where supported) model routing configured |
| `partial` | MCP and model config applied, but the managed launcher step was skipped, usually a missing agent binary. Not a failure. |
| `failed` | Enrollment error for this agent; see Reason |

The Reason column also carries live-validation outcomes. `live validation throttled - model traffic unverified` means enrollment succeeded but the verification prompt was rate-limited; the agent shows an **unverified** badge in the console until you re-verify with `preloop agents validate <agent> --live`. `live validation inconclusive (upstream billing/quota)` means the credential authenticated and reached the provider, but the provider refused the call: also re-verify later.

### Exit codes

- **0**: at least one attempted agent onboarded, fully or partially (and trivially when nothing was attempted). A single-agent `partial` also exits 0.
- **1**: every attempted agent failed, or another error occurred.

Script against the summary, not just the exit code, when you care about specific agents.

### WSL

If you run the CLI inside WSL but installed agents on the Windows side, onboarding prints:

```text
Hint: Running under WSL: agents installed on Windows are not on the WSL PATH - install the agent inside WSL or add its Windows install dir to PATH.
```

The CLI also runs natively on Windows: `amd64` and `arm64` binaries ship with
every release (install with PowerShell, see [Windows CLI install](../windows-cli.md)).
Running it inside WSL is a supported option too. See
[Windows](../operations/windows-wsl2.md) for setup and the current limits of the
native binary.

### Support levels

| Agent | MCP firewall | Model gateway routing | Agent Control (live channel) |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Claude Code | Yes | Yes | n/a |
| Codex CLI | Yes | Yes | n/a |
| Gemini CLI | Yes | Yes | n/a |
| OpenCode | Yes | Yes | n/a |
| Hermes | Yes | Yes | Yes (runtime plugin) |
| OpenClaw | Yes | Yes (OpenAI-compatible gateway) | Yes (runtime plugin) |
| Cursor | Yes | Manual BYOK: set the OpenAI base-URL override in Cursor's Settings → Models yourself; covers the AI panel incl. Agent mode | n/a |
| Claude Desktop | Yes | Yes, via managed config: `--model-route direct` or `apps-gateway` prints it for your MDM ([Claude Desktop](clients/claude-desktop.md)) | n/a |
| Windsurf | Yes | No | n/a |
| VS Code / Copilot | Yes | Manual BYOK: Chat: Manage Language Models -> Add Models -> Custom Endpoint, then `chatLanguageModels.json`. Full URLs end in `/openai/v1/chat/completions`, `/openai/v1/responses`, or `/anthropic/v1/messages`. Set `toolCalling: true`. Business and Enterprise need the admin BYOK policy. See [VS Code Copilot](clients/vscode-copilot.md) | n/a |
| Copilot CLI | Yes (`~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`) | No on onboard. `preloop copilot` launches the CLI with gateway env vars | n/a |
| Antigravity | Yes | No (locked to Google-hosted models) | n/a |
| Devin | Yes | No (inference runs in Cognition's cloud) | n/a |

"MCP firewall: Yes" means tool calls are governed. Automatic gateway rows meter every model call the adapter rewrites. Manual BYOK rows meter the calls the client sends to the gateway URLs above. GitHub-hosted Copilot models and Cursor bundled models stay on their own providers, so cost analytics and model budgets do not apply to that traffic.

Claude Code discovery: the CLI treats `~/.claude.json` or a `claude` binary on `PATH` as install markers (fresh installs have no `~/.claude/settings.json` yet) and bootstraps the canonical `~/.claude/settings.json` during onboarding.

## Policies

```bash
preloop policy list [--limit N] [--output table|json|yaml]   # policy versions, newest first
preloop policy validate <file>
preloop policy apply <file> [--dry-run] [-r]   # -r: recurse into a directory
preloop policy diff <file>
preloop policy export [-o file]
preloop policy generate "<prompt>" [-o file] [-f prompt-file] \
  [--from-audit-logs --start-date 2026-01-01 --end-date 2026-02-01] [--no-context]
```

## Tools and approvals

```bash
preloop tools list [-f table|json|yaml]
preloop tools describe <tool-name>
preloop tools exec <tool-name> --args '{"key": "value"}' [--timeout 60s]

preloop approvals list                 # approval workflows
preloop approvals pending [-l 20]
preloop approvals approve <request-id> [-r "reason"]
preloop approvals deny <request-id> [-r "reason"]
```

## Sessions

```bash
preloop sessions list [--active] [--agent <id|name>] [--kind <kind>] [--since 2h] \
  [--parent <session-id>] [--execution <id>] [--limit 50] [--json | -o id] [--wide]
preloop sessions attach <session-id|short-id> [--execution <id>] [--read-only] [--since 10m] [--json]
preloop agents attach <agent-id|name> [--no-wait] [--read-only] [--since 10m] [--json]
preloop sessions search "<query>" [--from 2026-09-01] [--to 2026-09-15] [--limit 20] [--json]
```

`sessions list` prints your account's runtime sessions, most recently active
first: short id (`--wide` for the full id and the agent kind), agent, started,
last activity, state (`live` for activity in the last 2 minutes, `idle` for
open but quiet, `ended`), tool calls, model calls, pending approvals and a
title. An untitled session is labelled with its agent kind, the base name of
the working directory its hook reported and its start time; if two rows on the
page would still share a label, the short id is appended.

| Flag | Server filter |
| --- | --- |
| `--active` | open sessions with activity in the last 10 minutes |
| `--agent <id\|name>` | one managed agent; an unknown name is refused, and a name shared by several agents asks for the id |
| `--kind <kind>` | `claude-code`, `codex`, `cursor`, `hermes`, ...: managed agents of that kind and sessions recorded from that source |
| `--since <duration>` | active within `30m`, `2h`, `7d`, ... (default: 30 days) |
| `--parent <session-id>` | only the sessions that session spawned |
| `--execution <id>` | only sessions linked to that flow execution |
| `--limit N` | at most N rows (default 50, at most 1000) |

`--json` prints the endpoint's own items (`GET /api/v1/runtime-sessions`), each
with `computed_title` and `state` added, under `{"total": ..., "items": [...]}`.
`-o id` prints one full id per line. The hint line naming
`preloop notes send --session` is printed only to a terminal. To steer the
session you found, see [Finding the session to steer](operator-notes.md#finding-the-session-to-steer).

`sessions attach` follows one session live (model requests, tool calls,
approvals, notes, the end), sends a typed line as an operator note and decides
a pending approval with `a` or `d`. On a managed agent with a live Agent
Control connection the input is in command mode instead: a typed line starts
a new turn and its delivery (queued, delivered, started, finished) is shown
inline; `/note <text>` still sends a note. `agents attach` does the same by
agent, attaching its current session or waiting for the next. See
[Attaching to a session from the terminal](sessions-attach.md).

`sessions search` ranks session content by relevance with the same server
query the console uses; `preloop sessions search --help` lists its flags.

## Artifacts

```bash
preloop artifacts put <file|-> --session <id> [--kind <kind>] [--name <name>] \
  [--label key=value ...] [--parent <artifact-id>] [--content-type <type>] [--json]
preloop artifacts ls --session <id> [--kind <kind>] [--label key=value ...] [--since 7d] [--limit 100] [--json]
preloop artifacts get <artifact-id> --session <id> [-o <file>]
```

These commands use the same deposit API as the console and the
`deposit_artifact` MCP tool (`/api/v1/runtime-sessions/{id}/artifacts`, see
[Artifacts](artifacts.md)).

`artifacts put` streams one file (or stdin with `-`) to the session and prints
the artifact id and a console link that opens the session at that artifact.
The media type comes from `--content-type`, then the file extension, then the
first bytes of the file. Stdin has no name to go by, so it needs
`--content-type`. Leave out `--kind` and the server picks one from the media
type: PNG, JPEG and WebP images become `screenshot`, audio becomes `audio`,
video becomes `recording`, `text/vtt` becomes `transcript`, plain text,
markdown and JSON become `document`, and any other file type (PDF, CSV, GIF,
...) becomes `generated_file`. Pass `--kind document` for
a PDF. Labels are `key=value`. Repeat `--label tags=...` to
build the `tags` list. A refusal prints the server's error code as sent, for
example `artifact_too_large (HTTP 413)`.

`artifacts ls` lists one session's artifacts, newest first. The server applies
`--kind` and `--label`. `--since` keeps artifacts created within that window
and stops paging at the first older one. `--session` is required for now,
because listing across every session needs the account-wide artifact search.

`artifacts get` streams the bytes to stdout, or with `-o` to a file. The file
is renamed into place only after the download completes. If the bytes were
evicted or expired, the command prints why (for example
`artifact <id> is no longer available: evicted (HTTP 410)`) and exits non-zero.

`--json` on `put` prints the API descriptor unchanged, including its MCP
`content_block` (a `resource_link`). On `ls` it prints `{"items": [...]}` with
each descriptor unchanged.

## Usage import

```bash
preloop usage import cursor-usage.csv                  # Cursor dashboard Usage export
preloop usage import events.json                       # normalized usage events
preloop usage import cursor-usage.csv --agent-id <id>  # explicit attribution
preloop usage import cursor-usage.csv --source cursor  # origin label (default: cursor)
preloop usage import export.csv --column-map '{"cost":"Cost to You"}'
```

Imports spend the model gateway never metered, such as Cursor's bundled Composer and Auto models. The endpoint is chosen from the file extension: `.csv` for a Cursor Usage export, `.json` for normalized events. Records are labeled as imported, reported separately from gateway-metered spend, and never counted against gateway budgets. Re-importing the same file is safe: duplicates are detected and reported as skipped.

Without `--agent-id` the account's onboarded Cursor agent is used, so run `preloop agents onboard cursor` first or pass an id explicitly. See [Importing usage from Cursor](cost/importing-cursor-usage.md).

## Version and updates

```bash
preloop version           # version, commit, build date
preloop version --check   # check for updates
```

The CLI checks for updates at most once per day. With `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` the check-in is disabled entirely: update notices are suppressed too, since they ride on the check-in response.
