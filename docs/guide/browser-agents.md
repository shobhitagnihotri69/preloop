# Browser steps

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

An agent that drives a browser can attach what it did to its runtime
session. Each step is an observation: the action the agent reports, the
URL or target it names, and the reasoning it gives. A stored step is not
an approval, a dispatch, or proof that the browser reached that state.

A step may carry a screenshot. It is stored encrypted as a
[session artifact](artifacts.md) of kind `screenshot`. The console fetches it
from the artifact byte route and shows it as a thumbnail on the step row (see
[In the console](#in-the-console)). A step without one has
`screenshot: null` in its stored metadata and renders as a row without a
thumbnail.

## Sending steps

Authenticate with the agent key, the same bearer the model gateway accepts.
Post one batch of 1 to 200 steps:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://preloop.example.com/api/v1/runtime-sessions/$SESSION_ID/browser-steps" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "steps": [
      {
        "source": "playwright_mcp",
        "source_step_id": "step-1",
        "step_index": 0,
        "action": "navigate",
        "url": "https://app.example.com/inbox",
        "reasoning": "Open the inbox the task named.",
        "status": "success"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

`source` is `api` (the default), `browser_use`, `skyvern`, or
`playwright_mcp`. `source_step_id` is the idempotency key together with
the session and `source`: posting the same key again returns the original
row and counts it as a duplicate. A batch may mix new steps, duplicates,
and rows that are refused individually.

The response is:

```json
{"accepted": 1, "duplicates": 0, "rejected": []}
```

`rejected` entries are `{"index": 0, "error": "extra_too_large"}`. `extra`
is refused when `json.dumps(extra)` is larger than 4096 bytes
(`extra_too_large`) or cannot be encoded as JSON (`extra_not_json`). A
screenshot is refused as `screenshot_too_large`, `screenshot_invalid` or
`storage_budget_exhausted` (see below). The other rows in the batch are
still stored. More than 200 steps, or an
empty batch, is a 422 for the whole request.

A missing or unknown bearer is 401. A session that belongs to another
account is 404. When the key is pinned to a runtime session and the path
names a different one, the response is 403. A session that has already
ended is accepted, including a key pinned to that session, so an adapter
can flush after the run. The model gateway still rejects that key for
inference.

## Screenshots

Add a `screenshot` object to a step:

```json
{
  "source": "playwright_mcp",
  "source_step_id": "step-2",
  "step_index": 1,
  "action": "screenshot",
  "screenshot": {
    "content_type": "image/png",
    "data_base64": "iVBORw0KGgo..."
  }
}
```

`content_type` is `image/png`, `image/jpeg` or `image/webp`. The row is
refused, and nothing is stored for it, when:

- the decoded image is larger than `RUNTIME_SESSION_SCREENSHOT_MAX_BYTES`
  (2 MiB by default): `screenshot_too_large`;
- `data_base64` is not valid base64, is empty, or the bytes are not the
  declared image type: `screenshot_invalid`;
- the account's session-artifact budget
  (`RUNTIME_SESSION_ARTIFACT_ACCOUNT_MAX_BYTES`) cannot fit the image even
  after evicting older unheld artifacts: `storage_budget_exhausted`.

A repeated step (same `source_step_id`) is a duplicate and does not store
a second image.

The stored step's `metadata.screenshot` names the artifact:

```json
{
  "artifact_id": "7d0c...",
  "availability": "available",
  "content_type": "image/png",
  "size_bytes": 48213
}
```

Each session keeps at most `RUNTIME_SESSION_SCREENSHOTS_PER_SESSION_MAX`
(500 by default) available screenshots. Past that, the oldest by step
time lose their image bytes. The artifact row and the step's metadata
stay, and `availability` becomes `evicted`. Screenshots in a session under
legal hold are never evicted, so a held session can keep more than the
bound.

### Reading a screenshot

A console user with the `view_runtime_sessions` permission reads the bytes
with:

```
GET /api/v1/runtime-sessions/{runtime_session_id}/artifacts/{artifact_id}
```

The response is the image with its stored media type and
`Cache-Control: private, max-age=300`. It is 404 when the session or the
artifact is not in the caller's account, or the artifact belongs to
another session, and 410 with `{"availability": "evicted"}` or
`{"availability": "expired"}` when the bytes are gone.

## Playwright MCP through the firewall

An agent that drives a browser through a Playwright MCP server
(`@playwright/mcp`) registered in Preloop needs no adapter. When the MCP
firewall proxies one of its `browser_*` tools on a runtime session, the
call is recorded as a `tool_call` activity as before and, in addition, as
a `browser_step` with `source: "playwright_mcp"`. The step's
`source_step_id` is the tool call's correlation id, so the two rows join
and a repeated derivation is a duplicate rather than a second step.
`step_index` continues from the highest index already stored on the
session, whichever source wrote it.

The mapping follows `@playwright/mcp@0.0.82`, the package pinned in the
browser environment profile:

| Tool | Action | Copied into the step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `browser_navigate`, `browser_navigate_back` | `navigate` | `url` |
| `browser_click` | `click` | `element` (or `ref`) as `target` |
| `browser_type` | `type` | `element`/`ref` as `target`; `extra.typed_chars` |
| `browser_press_key` | `type` | nothing |
| `browser_select_option` | `select` | `element`/`ref` as `target` |
| `browser_hover` | `other` | `element`/`ref` as `target` |
| `browser_take_screenshot` | `screenshot` | the returned image, as the screenshot |
| `browser_snapshot` | `extract` | nothing |
| `browser_wait_for` | `wait` | nothing |
| `browser_close` | `done` | nothing |

`extra.tool` names the tool that was called. The typed `text`, the pressed
`key` and the selected `values` are never stored; `browser_type` records
only the length of what was typed. A call the firewall refused (policy,
approval, kill switch) never reached the browser and derives no step. A
failed call derives a step with `status: "failed"`.

The image `browser_take_screenshot` returns is stored as the step's
screenshot under the same size, type and budget rules as an image posted
to the API. An image the rules refuse is dropped and the step is kept.
What the agent receives from the tool does not change.

Playwright MCP decides whether a tool result carries an image at all. Started
with `--image-responses omit`, it returns no `ImageContent`, so the firewall
has nothing to store: every derived step, including `browser_take_screenshot`,
is recorded with `screenshot: null` and the console shows the step without a
thumbnail and without a strip image. Keep the default (`allow`) when you want
screenshots in Preloop.

Set `MCP_PLAYWRIGHT_DERIVE_BROWSER_STEPS=false` to record those calls as
plain `tool_call` rows only. Other browser MCP servers are not derived;
post their steps through the API above.

## In the console

Open the session in **Sessions**. Every browser step renders inline in the
Conversation and Transcript views, in time order between the model turns
and tool calls around it: an action icon, the action and URL, the target,
the step index and the agent's reasoning (collapsed). A step with a
screenshot shows a thumbnail; click it for the full-size viewer, where the
arrow keys page through the session's steps and Escape closes it.

When a session has browser steps, a strip above the timeline lists one
entry per step. Click an entry to scroll the timeline to that step.

The console shows exactly what was stored: steps with `screenshot: null`
(for example from `--image-responses omit`, or a refused image) have no
thumbnail. It does not show the image the agent saw if that image was never
stored.

A screenshot that was evicted by a storage bound or expired under the
retention policy shows a grey placeholder with the reason and a link to
the session artifact storage card under **Settings > Account**. The step
itself stays.

## What is stored

Each accepted step is a `browser_step` activity on the session. It shows
up on the activity timeline next to tool calls, ordered by timestamp, and
its reasoning is searchable with session search. URL query secrets, and
credential-shaped text in the target and reasoning, are masked before the
row is stored.
