# Alibaba Cloud Model Studio

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

Choose **Alibaba Cloud Model Studio (Qwen)** when adding an AI model. Existing
configurations keep the provider identifier `qwen`; no migration is needed.

Set the API URL for the region of your Model Studio API key:

| Region | Compatible-mode base URL |
| --- | --- |
| Beijing, the default when omitted | `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` |
| Singapore International | `https://dashscope-intl.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` |
| Singapore workspace | `https://{workspace}.ap-southeast-1.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` |
| US | `https://dashscope-us.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1` |

Keys are regional. Use a Model Studio API key, not an Alibaba RAM AccessKey.
See Alibaba's [API key instructions](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/get-api-key).

**Fetch Models** queries a live provider catalog. The classic Singapore URL
uses the documented native catalog, with compatible-mode listing as a fallback;
workspace URLs stay on their configured host. Native page numbers and compatible
cursor pages are bounded to 50 pages and 1,000 model IDs, with an overall timeout.
A live listing describes the provider catalog; account entitlements and model
availability still determine whether a completion succeeds. Failed listing has
an explicit reason and does not substitute guessed model IDs.

The picker covers chat and agent models, including third-party models served by
Model Studio. Selecting DeepSeek, GLM, or Kimi there keeps Alibaba as the upstream.
Image/video generation, dedicated audio, translation, and separate Qwen-VL lines
are outside this picker. Pricing still reads the full native catalog (not only
text-generation SKUs). Listing a model is not an end-to-end compatibility test
of every capability it advertises.

## Chat and agent controls

Chat Completions supports streaming, tool calls, and provider token usage.
Responses requests use the chat adapter, with `reasoning.effort` translated to
Model Studio's reasoning control. Model-specific opaque reasoning-history
continuity is not guaranteed for every hosted model; validate an agent's tool
round trip when adopting a new model.

For supported models, send `enable_thinking` as a boolean and `thinking_budget`
as a non-negative integer. `reasoning_effort` also accepts the provider's
documented levels. Use effort or budget, not both; individual models can reject
controls they do not support. Arbitrary `extra_body` fields cannot override the
gateway's model, endpoint, or governed messages.

Explicit caching supports up to four `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`
markers on system/user text content blocks. This path is restricted to text
blocks; mixed image/file content with explicit markers is rejected. The gateway
preserves validated markers through its OpenAI-compatible adapter and records
the cache mode separately from provider usage. Cache hits are never guaranteed.

Legacy AI-driven approval workflows configure their model separately from saved
gateway models. Set `approval_config.provider` to `qwen` and provide
`approval_config.api_endpoint` for a Singapore/workspace key, including when the
model identifier belongs to a third-party family hosted by Alibaba.

## Cost reporting

Token counts come from provider usage when available. Reasoning tokens are a
breakdown of completion tokens and are not charged a second time. Cache-read
and cache-creation counts retain the provider's detailed usage.

Catalog dollar values are **estimates**, not invoices. Preloop uses Singapore
International USD list tariffs from a native `GET /api/v1/models` seed covering
the SKUs Model Studio returns for a Singapore International key, then overlays
live native prices when Fetch Models, Fetch price, or an unpriced-row lookup
succeeds. It does not substitute a native DeepSeek, Z.ai or Moonshot price for
an Alibaba-hosted model. Beijing and other CNY sites stay unpriced in USD
accounting. Time-banded Singapore International SKUs use Model Studio night
hours (22:00-08:00 UTC+8, idle) versus daytime (busy). Mixed-modality leftover
rates stay on the tariff as extra fields instead of being blended. Native rows
that publish no prices, and compatible-mode aliases that are not in the native
catalog (`ccai-pro`, `qwen-coder-plus`, `qwen2-7b-instruct`,
`qwq-plus-2025-03-05`), stay unpriced rather than guessed. Mixed leftover
audio or vision rates fail closed when usage reports those tokens on either
the prompt or the completion side.

See [Alibaba's model pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/model-pricing)
for published rates and [List models](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/model-studio/list-models)
for the native catalog. Cache rows from that USD native response are used as
estimates; they are still not invoices. Trial credits, negotiated discounts,
asynchronous discounts, cache storage fees, and the final account bill are not
inferred from token counts or a model listing.
Use Alibaba's billing console for actual charges and credit balances.
Cost reconciliation shows unpriced requests and tokens; aggregate estimated
spend totals include only known prices and can understate total spend.
