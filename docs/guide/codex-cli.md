# Codex CLI onboarding

Editions: OSS, Cloud, Enterprise. Unless stated otherwise, everything on this page ships in OSS.

`preloop agents onboard "Codex CLI"` enrolls Codex, routes model traffic
through the Preloop gateway, and can install approval hooks with
`--approvals`. Codex keeps `~/.codex/config.toml` for its own settings.
Agent Control does not write that file.

## Onboard, verify, roll back

```bash
preloop agents discover
preloop agents onboard "Codex CLI"              # MCP firewall + model gateway
preloop agents onboard "Codex CLI" --approvals  # also route tool calls to Preloop policy and approvals
```

Onboarding backs up `~/.codex/config.toml` (`~/.codex/config.json` is only a
legacy fallback) and adds a managed `[mcp_servers.preloop]` entry that points
at the Preloop MCP endpoint. `--approvals` adds hooks to `~/.codex/hooks.json`:
`PreToolUse` evaluates your central tool rules, and `PermissionRequest` turns
the prompts Codex would show you into Preloop approval requests you can answer
from mobile, watch, or the web console.

```bash
preloop agents status "Codex CLI"
preloop agents validate "Codex CLI"
preloop agents restore "Codex CLI"
preloop agents offboard "Codex CLI"
```

See the [CLI quick start](quickstart-cli.md), [Safety Layer and access
rules](concepts/safety-layer.md) and [Claude Code](clients/claude-code.md) for
the equivalent flow on other agents.

## Agent Control sidecar

Codex has no in-process plugin API for operator messages, so Agent Control
runs as a sidecar:

- package `@preloop-ai/codex-plugin`
- command `preloop-codex-plugin`
- source `runtime-plugins/codex-preloop`
- config `~/.codex/preloop-control.json`

Onboarding installs the package with npm when it is published, or from the
local source directory when that checkout is present. It writes the same
control keys the Claude sidecar uses (`enabled`, `protocol`, `runtime`,
`control_ws_url`, `bearer_token`, and the runtime identity fields). Nothing
Codex-specific is added to that file.

```bash
preloop agents onboard "Codex CLI"
preloop agents validate "Codex CLI"
preloop codex sidecar enable
preloop codex sidecar status
preloop codex sidecar disable
```

`validate` reports `control_config_written`, `control_plugin_installed`,
`control_plugin_verified`, and `control_channel_configured` separately.
`preloop codex sidecar run` execs `preloop-codex-plugin run` against the
control file. It is the command launchd and systemd start.

Offboard removes `~/.codex/preloop-control.json` and the sidecar service.
`~/.codex/config.toml` is restored from the onboarding backup and is not
rewritten by Agent Control.

Codex refreshes its ChatGPT login on its own, even when model traffic goes
through Preloop, and the Preloop gateway refreshes the copy it stores. That
login uses a single-use refresh token, so two holders of one grant revoke
each other when either refreshes with a stale token. The Codex permission
hook keeps both copies on the same lineage. It pushes the local bundle
(`~/.codex/auth.json`, or the macOS Keychain entry when Codex keeps its login
there) when it is newer than the stamp in the local enrollment state. About
every two minutes it also reads Preloop's rotation marker, which carries no
tokens, and when Preloop's copy is newer it writes that bundle back into the
same place Codex reads it. When both copies changed since the last sync, the
one with the later `last_refresh` wins and replaces the other. A pull only
happens when the local login and Preloop's copy name the same ChatGPT
account. A failed push or pull is logged once, leaves the local login and the
stamp as they were, and does not change the permission decision. A host with
no local login never gets one written back. When the hook is not installed, run
`preloop agents sync-credentials "Codex CLI"`; it reconciles in both
directions and prints which one ran.

For headless hosts, a single holder is still the recommendation: import the
login into Preloop, delete the local `auth.json`, and keep
`requires_openai_auth = false` (the default) on the Preloop model provider in
`~/.codex/config.toml`, so only Preloop refreshes the grant.

If the provider has already revoked the grant, synchronization cannot repair it.
Run `preloop agents reconnect "Codex CLI"` to sign in and replace only the stored
subscription credential, preserving the enrollment and configuration. After a
separate `codex login`, use `preloop agents reconnect "Codex CLI" --from-local`.
Update the CLI if this command is not in your installed release. Recovery uploads
the bundle to one credential and attaches legacy split model rows to that owner;
it never creates multiple stored copies of the rotating token. The server rejects
recently consumed refresh tokens and stops retrying provider-declared invalid
grants until fresh credentials are supplied. Transient failures remain retryable.
Independent hosts and instances should obtain separate authorization grants;
the hook cannot make concurrent refreshes by independent holders atomic.

To push a Codex login through the API yourself, send `PUT /api/v1/ai-models/{id}`
with `credential_type: "oauth_openai_codex"` and a `credential_payload` in
Preloop's shape, not the key names from `auth.json`:

```json
{
  "access": "<access token>",
  "refresh": "<refresh token>",
  "account_id": "<ChatGPT account id>",
  "expires": 1893456000000
}
```

`access`, `refresh`, and `account_id` must be non-empty strings. `expires` is
the access-token expiry as an integer in epoch milliseconds. The server checks
the payload when you write it and answers 422 with the missing or invalid keys,
without storing anything. `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_at` are
rejected with a hint that names the expected key, and an `expires` in epoch
seconds or microseconds is rejected too. This is the same shape
`POST /api/v1/ai-models/{id}/credentials/export` returns.
