# Preloop CLI

Command-line interface for managing AI agent policies, approvals, and MCP tools.

## Installation

### Installer (recommended)

macOS / Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://preloop.ai/install/cli | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://preloop.ai/install/cli.ps1 | iex
```

See [docs/windows-cli.md](../docs/windows-cli.md) for Defender false-positive
recovery and Git Bash `i686` architecture issues.

### From Source / `go install`

```bash
# Requires a Go toolchain — preferred on Windows when AV flags downloads
go install github.com/preloop/preloop/cli/cmd/preloop@latest

# Or clone and build
git clone https://github.com/preloop/preloop.git
cd preloop/cli
make install   # or: make build && ./build/preloop --help
```

To run a checkout as your everyday `preloop` (for example at
`~/.local/bin/preloop`), use `make install-local`; see
[Installing a dev build](#installing-a-dev-build) below. Never `cp` a build
onto an existing binary.

### Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/preloop/preloop/releases)
and verify against the `SHA256SUMS` asset.

## Pi and DeepSeek Harness

Use `preloop agents install-runtime pi` or `preloop agents install-runtime deepseek`
to install and onboard. Existing installations can use
`preloop agents onboard Pi --approvals` or
`preloop agents onboard "DeepSeek Harness" --approvals`.
Both support model routing, MCP, native approvals, and active-session control.
See the [runtime guide](../runtime-plugins/harness-preloop/README.md) for configuration,
custom home directories, offboarding, and supported versions.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Authenticate with a token
preloop login --token <your-token>

# Authenticate with a token and custom API URL
preloop login --token <your-token> --url http://localhost:8000

# OAuth login on a local machine
preloop login

# Create a Preloop account and authenticate the CLI in the same OAuth flow
preloop signup

# OAuth login over SSH or on a headless host
preloop login --headless

# OAuth login against a custom environment
PRELOOP_URL=https://review.preloop.ai preloop login --headless

# Check authentication status
preloop auth status

# List policies
preloop policy list

# Validate a policy file
preloop policy validate my-policy.yaml

# Apply a policy
preloop policy apply my-policy.yaml

# List pending approvals
preloop approvals pending

# Approve a request
preloop approvals approve <request-id>
```

## Commands

### Authentication

```bash
preloop login --token <token>        # Save an API token
preloop login                        # Auto-select loopback or headless OAuth
preloop login --headless             # Force copy/paste OAuth
preloop login --loopback             # Force local loopback OAuth
preloop signup                       # Open the sign-up page, then authenticate the CLI
preloop auth login                   # Same as preloop login
preloop auth signup                  # Same as preloop signup
preloop auth logout                  # Clear local credentials
preloop auth logout --all            # Revoke every session, then clear local credentials
preloop auth status                  # Show authentication status
preloop auth token                   # Print token for scripting
```

The login flow resolves the API URL in this order: `--url`, `PRELOOP_URL`, config file, then the default `https://preloop.ai`.

### Signing out and revoking a login

`preloop auth logout` only deletes the tokens stored on this machine. Other
CLI hosts and the console stay signed in. To revoke every JWT session for
the signed-in user (this host, other hosts, and the console), run
`preloop auth logout --all`. That calls `POST /auth/sessions/revoke-all`,
which increments the user's `auth_generation` so every outstanding access
and refresh token fails the next time it is used. API keys and runner
tokens are not affected.

If the server cannot be reached, `--all` still clears the local file and
prints that other sessions remain valid. The console Account Security page
has the same control as **Sign out everywhere**.

### Policy Management

```bash
preloop policy list                    # List all policies
preloop policy validate <file>         # Validate a policy file
preloop policy apply <file>            # Apply a policy
preloop policy apply <file> --dry-run  # Preview changes without applying
preloop policy diff <file>             # Compare local vs remote policy
preloop policy export <name>           # Export a policy to file
```

### MCP Tools

```bash
preloop tools list                               # List tools visible to this token
preloop tools describe <tool-name>              # Show schema and description
preloop tools exec <tool-name> --args '{"k":"v"}'
preloop tools exec <tool-name> --args-file ./input.json
```

`preloop tools` talks directly to the MCP endpoint, so the visible and executable tools are automatically filtered by the current token's policy. Agent tokens only see the tools they are allowed to use.

### Codex CLI Agent Control

```bash
preloop agents onboard "Codex CLI"
preloop agents validate "Codex CLI"
preloop codex sidecar enable
preloop codex sidecar status
preloop codex sidecar disable
```

Onboarding installs `@preloop-ai/codex-plugin` (`preloop-codex-plugin`) and
writes `~/.codex/preloop-control.json`. `~/.codex/config.toml` stays
Codex's own file. `preloop codex sidecar run` execs
`preloop-codex-plugin run`. See
[docs/guide/codex-cli.md](../docs/guide/codex-cli.md).

### Cursor Agent CLI

```bash
preloop cursor                         # interactive TTY passthrough
preloop cursor run "summarize this repo"   # headless capture + estimated usage
```

`preloop cursor` spawns `cursor-agent` with the user's TTY. Interactive
sessions are unchanged and are not captured: Cursor only emits structured
output in `--print` mode. `preloop cursor run` injects
`--print --output-format stream-json`, tees stdout, and POSTs estimated
usage to `/api/v1/usage/ingest`. Runs bill the user's own Cursor account;
Preloop records estimates, not Cursor billing. See
[docs/guide/cursor-cli.md](../docs/guide/cursor-cli.md).

### Copilot CLI

```bash
preloop copilot --model openai/gpt-5
preloop copilot --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5 --provider anthropic
```

`preloop copilot` starts the GitHub Copilot CLI with BYOK environment
variables pointed at the Preloop gateway. A missing binary, credential, or
model alias exits without launching Copilot. `--token` and `PRELOOP_TOKEN`
override the enrolled agent credential. See
[docs/guide/copilot-cli.md](../docs/guide/copilot-cli.md).

### Usage

```bash
preloop usage import cursor-usage.csv                # Cursor dashboard Usage export
preloop usage import events.json                     # Normalized usage events
preloop usage import cursor-usage.csv --agent-id <id>
preloop usage import export.csv --column-map '{"cost":"Cost to You"}'

# Live / harness events (generic NDJSON, Cursor hooks, or Codex rollouts)
preloop usage hook                                   # stdin; auto-detects format
preloop usage hook --from generic --source my-harness
preloop usage hook --from codex --file ~/.codex/sessions/2026/08/31/rollout-....jsonl
```

`preloop usage import` loads a CSV or JSON file of already-observed spend.
`preloop usage hook` streams or imports conversation events into
`POST /api/v1/usage/ingest`. See
[docs/guide/usage-hooks.md](../docs/guide/usage-hooks.md).

Imported records are labeled as imported, so they are reported separately
from gateway-metered spend and never count against gateway budgets.
Re-importing the same file is safe: duplicates are detected and reported
as skipped. Without `--agent-id`, the account's onboarded agent matching
`--source` is used.

### Approvals

```bash
preloop approvals list                 # List all approvals
preloop approvals pending              # List pending approvals
preloop approvals approve <id>         # Approve a request
preloop approvals deny <id>            # Deny a request
```

### Agents

```bash
preloop agents discover                 # Interactive discovery; can prompt to onboard
preloop agents discover --json          # Emit discovery results as JSON
preloop agents discover --no-onboard-prompt
preloop agents discover --yes           # Auto-onboard newly discovered agents
preloop agents enroll openclaw        # Apply managed enrollment for OpenClaw
preloop agents enroll openclaw --dry-run
preloop agents enroll openclaw --yes   # Skip the confirmation prompt
preloop agents enroll hermes          # Apply managed enrollment for Hermes
preloop agents enroll hermes --dry-run
preloop agents install-runtime hermes # Install Hermes locally, then onboard
preloop agents install-runtime openclaw -y --model openai/gpt-5.4
preloop agents install-runtime hermes --skip-install -y  # Onboard an existing install
preloop agents status openclaw         # Show local/remote managed state
preloop agents status hermes
preloop agents validate openclaw       # Validate the managed config
preloop agents validate hermes
preloop agents restore openclaw        # Restore the most recent local backup
preloop agents restore hermes
preloop agents offboard openclaw       # Offboard and restore the local backup
preloop agents offboard hermes
preloop agents offboard openclaw --yes --remove-model no --remove-mcp-servers no
preloop agents offboard openclaw --yes --remove-model yes
preloop agents refresh                  # Rewrite managed model sections from the catalog
preloop agents sync                     # Alias for agents refresh
```

`preloop agents discover` is the starting point for agent onboarding. In interactive terminals it can prompt to onboard newly discovered agents one by one. Use `--no-onboard-prompt` to keep discovery read-only in scripts/CI, or `--yes` to auto-onboard all new candidates. `preloop agents enroll openclaw` remains the explicit mutating command.

Managed OpenClaw and Hermes onboarding creates a durable managed credential, backs up the local config, adds or replaces the local MCP config with a managed `preloop` entry, writes a `preloop.control.control_ws_url` contract plus the standalone runtime plugin package name (`preloop-hermes-plugin` or `@preloop-ai/openclaw-plugin`), and may also import existing MCP servers plus rewrite supported model settings to Preloop's OpenAI-compatible gateway. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes first. `preloop agents onboard --all -y` also ensures every discovered OpenClaw/Hermes runtime plugin available to the CLI is installed and verified, including agents that were already onboarded locally and would otherwise be skipped by the config rewrite step.

`install-runtime hermes` and `install-runtime openclaw` use their official
publisher installers to obtain the current runtime and its dependencies. They
require Bash and curl on Linux/macOS; OpenClaw's installer also configures a
user-writable npm prefix. Hermes' published PyPI package can lag current releases,
so it is not used for fresh runtime installs. Pass `--model <gateway-alias>` to
select an existing account model, including on a host with no agent configuration.
Installation may need permission to install operating system dependencies.

The CLI provisions credentials and configuration, and `preloop agents install-plugin <agent>` delegates to the runtime's own plugin marketplace installer. The runtime plugin, not the CLI, owns the long-lived WebSocket connection to `/api/v1/agents/control/ws`, reconnect/backoff, heartbeat and status events, capability advertisement, command receipt, and command execution or message injection into the active agent session. Runtime builds that have not loaded the native Agent Control plugin can ignore the control block safely; MCP firewall and gateway routing can still work, but Agent Control is not enabled. `preloop agents validate` reports `control_config_written`, `control_plugin_installed`, `control_plugin_verified`, and `control_channel_configured` separately so a metadata block is not mistaken for a live control channel.

`preloop agents offboard` restores the last local backup and removes the managed agent from Preloop. Cleanup of account-level resources is controlled separately:

- `--remove-model ask|yes|no` controls whether an eligible AI model should also be removed from Preloop
- `--remove-mcp-servers ask|yes|no` controls whether eligible MCP servers should also be removed from Preloop

Both flags default to `ask`. With `--yes` alone, the CLI skips the main offboard confirmation but keeps eligible AI models and MCP servers unless you explicitly opt into removing them. Shared resources are protected automatically:

- AI models are kept if they are still referenced by another managed agent or by any flow
- MCP servers are kept if they are still referenced by another managed agent
- Recently active shared resources are also skipped

`preloop agents refresh` (alias `sync`) re-fetches the authorized model list and rewrites only the managed model sections of onboarded agent configs. Selection, credentials, MCP config, and local backups are preserved.

### Operator notes

```bash
preloop notes send --agent <agent-id> "Deploy to eu-west-1, not us-east-1."
preloop notes send --session <session-id> "Stop refactoring the tests, ship the fix."
preloop notes send --execution <execution-id> "The deadline moved to Friday."
echo "Use the staging cluster in eu-west-1." | preloop notes send --agent <agent-id>
preloop notes send --agent <agent-id> --expires-in 2h "Skip the staging rollout."
preloop notes send --agent <agent-id> --json "Use eu-west-1."
```

`preloop notes send` posts one note to `POST /api/v1/operator-notes`, which
delivers it at the agent's next turn boundary. Name exactly one target:
`--agent` steers the agent's current session, or the next one it opens when
none is live, `--session` steers that conversation only, and `--execution`
is resolved server side to the session the flow execution runs on. Naming
none or naming two is refused locally, before any request.

The body is the argument. With no argument it is read from standard input,
so a note can be piped or written in a heredoc, and a multi line body is
sent as written. `--expires-in` takes a Go duration and overrides the
server's 24 hour default. `--json` emits the note id and the target and
nothing else. A refusal prints the server's own reason, including the
"target not found" and rate limit cases, and exits non-zero.

Sending a note needs the `control_managed_agent` permission, the same one
that lets you stop the agent, and every note is written to the audit trail
with its author. Reading and cancelling notes stays in the console and the
API for now. See [docs/guide/operator-notes.md](../docs/guide/operator-notes.md).

### Session search

```bash
preloop sessions search "rolling restart"
preloop sessions search '"rolling restart" -staging'     # phrase, with an exclusion
preloop sessions search kubectl or helm                  # alternation
preloop sessions search kubectl --from 2026-09-01 --to 2026-09-15
preloop sessions search kubectl --limit 120              # pages past one request
preloop sessions search kubectl --json | jq -r '.results[].runtime_session_id'
```

`preloop sessions search` calls `POST /api/v1/runtime-sessions/search`, the
ranked keyword search over recorded session content: model calls, tool calls,
transcript messages, operator notes and session summaries. The body is a POST
so the query text stays out of proxy and access logs. Nothing about the query
is interpreted by the CLI, so the same words return the same answer here and
in the console.

Default output is one block per session: the session id and the source
type/id you already type, the reference and title when set, when it ran, why
it matched (how many chunks, the fused score) and each matching turn with its
timestamp. `<mark>` markup from the server's headline generator is stripped in
that view and kept in `--json`.

`--json` writes each response page exactly as the endpoint sent it, one
document per page, so it can be piped into `jq`. Every note the human reader
needs goes to standard error instead: a degraded ranking mode (asking for
`--mode semantic` on a deployment that cannot rank semantically), how far the
corpus is indexed, and the result count. That keeps the piped payload a clean
document while a human still sees that coverage was partial.

`--limit` is the total number of sessions to retrieve and `--page-size` how
many per request (at most 50, the server's cap); a `--limit` above the page
size is paged by offset automatically.

Exit status is what a script branches on: `0` when something matched, `2` when
the search ran and matched nothing, `1` when it could not be answered. An
endpoint failure prints one sentence, never a server stack trace. Searching
needs the `view_runtime_sessions` permission.

### Models

```bash
preloop models sync                     # Pull newly released provider models into the catalog
preloop models sync --provider anthropic
preloop models sync --dry-run           # Report what would be added without writing
```

`preloop models sync` calls `POST /api/v1/ai-models/sync` so newly released provider models enter the account catalog from credentials already stored on existing models. Then run `preloop agents refresh` to push those models into onboarded agent configs.

### Flows

```bash
preloop flow trigger <flow-id-or-name>
preloop flow trigger nightly-review --payload '{"ref":"main"}'
cat event.json | preloop flow trigger nightly-review --payload -
preloop flow trigger nightly-review --wait --timeout 30m
preloop flow trigger nightly-review --runner local
```

In CI (stdin is not a TTY) the command waits by default and streams
execution logs to stdout. The same logs remain in the console execution
view. Exit status is non-zero on FAILED, STOPPED, or TIMEOUT. Auth is
`--token`, `PRELOOP_TOKEN`, or the saved login. See
[docs/guide/flows/ci-trigger.md](../docs/guide/flows/ci-trigger.md).

### Version

```bash
preloop version                        # Show version info
preloop version --check                # Check for updates
preloop update                         # Install the latest CLI release
preloop update --check                 # Print current vs latest and exit
preloop update --yes                   # Install without prompting
```

`preloop update` downloads the GitHub release asset for this OS/architecture
(the same URL as `scripts/install-cli.sh`) and replaces the current binary
in place. The daily update notice asks whether to upgrade when stdin is a
TTY and the binary is writable; otherwise it stays silent. Version lookup
is skipped when `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` is set.

A dev build made with `make build` reports the `git describe` form
(`v0.15.0-678-g5c9e8bc3`, N commits past the last tag). That counts as newer
than the `0.15.0` release: `preloop update --check` prints
`newer than latest release` and the daily notice stays quiet. Real
prereleases (`0.15.0-beta.1`, `0.15.0-rc1`) still count as older than the
release.

### Self-hosted runner

```bash
preloop runner fg --labels local     # Foreground: register, heartbeat, lease jobs
preloop runner fg --concurrency 4    # Hold four executions at once (default 2)
preloop runner enable                # Install launchd / systemd / scheduled task
preloop runner disable
preloop runner start|stop|restart|status
```

`preloop runner fg` opens a durable WebSocket to the configured server,
leases executions whose runner pool matches this runner's id, name, or
labels, streams logs, and honors halt. Ctrl-C unregisters. Persist the
runner id and token in `~/.preloop/runner.json`.

One runner runs several executions at once. Each job gets its own
workspace, log stream and halt, so stopping one execution leaves the
others running. The number of slots comes from `--concurrency`, then
`PRELOOP_RUNNER_CONCURRENCY`, then `runner.concurrency` in
`~/.preloop/config.yaml`, then the default of 2 (maximum 32):

```yaml
runner:
  concurrency: 4
```

The account owner also sets a ceiling per runner on the console Runners
page. A process that asks for less than the ceiling gets less; asking for
more than the owner allows does not raise it.


### Native approval hooks and central policy

Onboard Claude Code, Cursor, or Codex CLI with `--approvals` to install the
supported native permission hooks. **Compatibility change:** installed hooks
now send locally allowed calls to Preloop for native-rule evaluation. Local
deny stays deny without a network request. A local allow with no matching
central rule remains allow without a human prompt; a matching native rule can
deny it or require approval. Existing Cursor safe-read and workspace policies
supply client context and no longer bypass central rules.

If Preloop is unavailable, the credential is missing, or a remote approval
expires, the hook denies the call. Claude/Cursor no longer fall back to a local
prompt, because it cannot enforce the central rule. The existing hook-command
`--fail-open` flag explicitly allows transport failures/timeouts and HTTP 5xx
unavailability. Missing credentials, HTTP 4xx (including authentication and rate
denials), malformed responses, and returned server/human/policy denials or
approval expiry stay closed.
The server governance setting `native_tool_approvals=off` disables automatic
human escalation, while matching native rules still apply. Offboarding removes
the installed approval hooks and their credentials.

New installs get a 24-hour wait budget, covering the maximum workflow duration even
when an agent or native rule selects a different workflow from the account
default. The server returns as soon as it decides or the workflow expires. The
HTTP timeout adds 15 seconds; the host hook deadline adds 30 seconds. Re-onboard
existing hooks to refresh credentials and hook command deadlines. Re-onboarding
preserves an existing wait budget and does not raise it to 24 hours. Any
`timeout_seconds` in `(0, 86400]` in
`~/.preloop/agents/<agent>/permission_hook.json` is kept, including older
account-workflow snapshots. To raise the budget, set `timeout_seconds` in that
file (86400 for the current ceiling) and re-onboard so the host deadline matches.
A shorter budget can deny before a longer workflow completes. Host-enforced
limits and proxy timeouts can still cut a request short. OpenCode plugin
onboarding retains its separate account-workflow timeout configuration.

**Repository context.** When the hook event's cwd is inside a git work tree, the hook resolves the toplevel, the `origin` remote, and the path of cwd relative to the toplevel, within 500 ms, and sends that as `repository`. A timeout or any git error omits the field. No `origin` remote is recorded as `no_remote`. A directory outside a work tree records nothing. The value is an observation of the hook cwd, not of tool arguments, and it does not change policy evaluation. Linked worktrees report the worktree toplevel. Only `origin` is read. Strings are bounded to 512 bytes, and the remote is normalized to `host/owner/repo` with credentials removed. See [Tool configuration and approval workflow](../docs/architecture/approvals.md).

Coverage follows the host's actual hook events: Claude Code uses `PreToolUse`;
Cursor uses `beforeShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, and `preToolUse`, with
deduplication only while the corresponding dedicated hook is installed. Cursor
invocations of Claude's third-party hook remain separate: onboard Cursor itself
to govern those calls. Codex installs both `PreToolUse` and `PermissionRequest`.
Its pre-tool check
uses `evaluation_phase=pre_tool_use` without claiming a local policy allow:
central rules may deny or require approval, while no matching rule adds no
prompt. A central allow returns neutral `{}`, leaving Codex's own permission
checks intact. `PermissionRequest` independently routes any native host prompt
through Preloop. When both a central rule and the host require approval, two
separate approval gates can appear. The documented PermissionRequest event has
no `tool_use_id`, so no approval is cached or reused across those events.

Current [Codex hook documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/hooks/)
covers shell/unified exec, `apply_patch`, MCP, and most local function tools.
Hosted tools and specialized paths can be outside coverage; `write_stdin` does
not run a fresh pre-tool hook for an existing session. Re-onboard existing Codex
installations to add PreToolUse, and install a backend supporting the new phase
before upgrading the hook configuration. These guarantees require the host to
run and honor its trusted hooks; an operator who removes or bypasses them opts
out.

Re-onboarding OpenClaw/Hermes preserves valid operator approval enable/fail-open
settings and 30–86400 second wait caps, while refreshing tokens, identity, and
endpoints. Invalid old values are not copied into the new configuration.

## Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.preloop/config.yaml`:

```yaml
access_token: <your-access-token>
refresh_token: <your-refresh-token>
api_url: http://localhost:8000
```

### Global Flags

All commands accept these flags:

- `--token <token>` - Override the access token for this invocation
- `--url <url>` - Override the API base URL for this invocation
- `--verbose` / `-v` - Enable verbose output

### Environment Variables

- `PRELOOP_TOKEN` - Override the access token
- `PRELOOP_URL` - Override the API base URL

### Resolution Priority

Authentication and URL resolution use these rules:

1. Token: `--token`, then `PRELOOP_TOKEN`, then the config file.
2. API URL: `--url`, then `PRELOOP_URL`, then the config file, then `https://preloop.ai`.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- Make

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
make build

# Cross-compile for all platforms
make build-all

# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter
make lint
```

### Installing a dev build

The only sanctioned way to update a local dev CLI is:

```bash
make install-local                      # build, then install(1) to ~/.local/bin/preloop
make install-local BINDIR=/opt/bin      # or PREFIX=... ; INSTALL_MODE=555 for a read-only file
```

Never `cp build/preloop ~/.local/bin/preloop`. `cp` writes into the existing
file's inode, and on macOS the next exec of that binary is killed with
`SIGKILL (Code Signature Invalid)` because the kernel's cached signature no
longer matches the bytes. `install(1)` unlinks the target and creates a new
file, which is what keeps the signature cache valid.

Never `go build -o ~/.local/bin/preloop` either. It skips the version
ldflags, so the binary reports the compiled-in fallback version (`0.15.0`
today) and is indistinguishable from the release to the update check, and it
replaces the file even when the target is read-only.

On macOS dev machines, guard the installed binary:

```bash
chmod a-w ~/.local/bin/preloop          # or: make install-local INSTALL_MODE=555
```

A read-only target still installs (unlinking needs directory write access,
not file write access), a stray `cp` fails with "Permission denied" instead
of corrupting it, and `preloop update` honours the guard: it checks whether
the binary is writable and stays silent (or, when invoked directly, refuses)
rather than replacing a dev build with the release. `make install-local`
recreates the file with `INSTALL_MODE` (default 755), so re-apply the
`chmod` afterwards or install with `INSTALL_MODE=555`.
