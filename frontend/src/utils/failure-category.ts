 * Why a flow run failed, in one word the console can group by.

 * raising code, the shape of the message and the executor's own analysis of
 * the logs (issue #361), and stores one of a closed vocabulary. The console
 * never re-derives it from `error_message`: a heuristic in the browser and a
 * heuristic on the server would disagree, and only one of them is stored.
 *
 * Every surface that lists a failed run shows the same chip from here, so
 * "runner conflict" means the same thing on the executions table, the run
 * page, the attention evidence and the feed.
