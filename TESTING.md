# Preloop Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Preloop application, covering unit, integration, and production smoke tests.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are designed to test individual components in isolation. They are written using `pytest` for the backend and Web Test Runner for the frontend.

### Coverage

Code coverage is measured for all components and is enforced in the CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to maintain a high level of coverage, with a target of at least 75% overall (CI `--fail-under=60`) and 80% for most components.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend (requires DATABASE_URL and PostgreSQL)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/preloop"
pytest -m "not integration" -v

# With coverage
pytest -m "not integration" --cov=preloop --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Quick unit tests (no database; use mocks)
pytest backend/tests/utils backend/tests/schemas backend/tests/models/test_db_session.py backend/tests/test_tokens_util.py -v

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run test
```

### Agent Control Validation

Use these targeted checks when changing Agent Control, managed-agent onboarding,
runtime sessions, account realtime, or mobile/watch approval and voice surfaces.
The checklist separates implemented backend/CLI behavior from mobile and native
runtime scaffolds so the slice is clear about what is shipped versus dependent
on OpenClaw/Hermes adapters.

```bash
# Backend Agent Control WebSocket/command routing and realtime plumbing.
# Add/keep test_agent_control.py with the Agent Control slice.
pytest backend/tests/endpoints/test_agent_control.py backend/tests/endpoints/test_websockets.py backend/tests/services/test_websocket_manager.py -v

# Backend managed-agent, gateway, approvals, and session-adjacent services
pytest backend/tests/agents backend/tests/services/test_approval_service.py backend/tests/services/test_mcp_client_pool.py backend/tests/endpoints/test_gateway_usage_summary.py -v

# CLI adapters, including OpenClaw and Hermes enrollment/gateway rewrites.
# These validate provisioning/configuration, not live Agent Control delivery.
(cd cli && go test -v -race -count=1 ./...)

# Hermes deployed integration smoke, from backend with integration deps installed
(cd backend && pytest --confcutdir=tests/integration tests/integration/test_hermes_onboarding.py -v -s)

# Frontend runtime-session/managed-agent views
(cd frontend && npm run test && npm run build)

# iOS app/watch Agent Control and approval validation
(cd ../ios && xcodebuild \
  -project Preloop.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Preloop \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  build test)

# Android local validation
(cd ../android && ./gradlew test assembleDebug)
```

For runtime-plugin validation, pair the backend and CLI checks with native
OpenClaw/Hermes adapter smoke tests once those projects implement Agent Control.
The plugin should load from the CLI-written `preloop.control` config, connect to
`WS /api/v1/agents/control/ws`, own reconnect/backoff, send heartbeat and status
envelopes, advertise capabilities, receive a `send_message` command from
`POST /api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/control/commands`, execute it or inject it as a
normal user/operator turn, and keep resulting tool/model calls on the governed
MCP and gateway paths. Without that loaded plugin, MCP/gateway onboarding can be
valid while Agent Control remains disabled.

### Current Status & Progress

Significant progress has been made in increasing unit test coverage for the backend.

**Models & CRUD:** `issue.py`, `issue_duplicate.py`, `organization.py`, `project.py`, `account.py`, `policy_snapshot.py`, `registration_token.py`, `instance.py`, `tool_access_rule.py` meet or exceed 80%.

**Sync:** `core.py` (scanner), `event_bus.py`, `base.py`, `manager.py` exceed 80%. `sync/utils.py` (retry, safe_exit) at 100%.

**API Endpoints:** `issues.py` (70%), `issue_duplicates.py` (70%), `issue_compliance.py` (100%), `embedding.py`, `roles.py`, `version.py`, `account.py`, `public_approval.py`, `policies.py` have comprehensive tests.

**Services:** `approval_service.py` (63%), `policy_evaluator.py`, `approval_wrapper.py`, `execution_metrics.py`, `push_proxy.py` have substantial coverage.

**Schemas:** `invitation`, `team`, `user`, `installers` at 100%.

**Utils:** `tokens`, `hashing`, `audit`, `permissions`, `redaction`, `encryption`, `request` at 100%.

### CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) shards backend unit tests
(`pytest -m "not integration"`) across eighteen jobs with
[pytest-split](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-split/). Shard boundaries
come from `.github/pytest-split-durations.json`, so each job stays under
seven minutes. A shard reuses a Postgres already listening on
`127.0.0.1:5432` and creates one database for the job; otherwise it
starts `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`. Self-hosted setup is
[`.github/self-hosted-runners.md`](.github/self-hosted-runners.md).
Coverage data is combined in a follow-up **Backend Coverage** job before
the 60% floor is applied; a single shard only exercises part of the tree,
so `--cov-fail-under` cannot run there.
Pull requests skip backend, frontend, CLI, plugin, and Helm jobs when
those trees did not change; `main` always runs every suite. The
required check is the **CI** aggregator (a skipped suite is success; a
failed suite is not). A new push to the same PR cancels the in-progress
run. Docker image builds run on `main` and tags, not on pull requests.

GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) splits the same suite into per-component
jobs for parallel execution and reporting, such as
`test:unit:preloop-sync` and individual endpoint tests like
`test:unit:preloop-endpoints-mcp`.

### Mutation Testing

To ensure the quality of our tests, we use mutation testing to identify and improve weak tests that are not effectively testing the code.

### Detailed Coverage Plan

See [docs/TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md](docs/TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md) for the full coverage plan, measuring instructions, and phase-by-phase implementation history.

## Integration and Functional Tests

Integration and functional tests are designed to test the application as a whole, including its interactions with external services.

### Test Environment

A dedicated test environment is set up in a Kubernetes cluster. The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys feature branches to this environment, allowing for automated testing of new features.

### API Tests

API integration tests are written using `pytest` and `httpx`. They cover end-to-end user flows, such as creating a project, adding a tracker, and searching for issues.

#### MCP Integration Tests

Integration tests for MCP endpoints are part of the tracker synchronization test suite:
- `tests/integration/test_tracker_sync_github.py`
- `tests/integration/test_tracker_sync_gitlab.py`
- `tests/integration/test_tracker_sync_jira.py`

These tests use a direct Python MCP client (`tests/integration/mcp_client.py`) that connects via HTTP to the Preloop MCP endpoint. This approach provides:
- **Fast execution**: Direct HTTP calls instead of spawning CLI processes
- **Reliable testing**: Uses the official `mcp` Python client library
- **Complete coverage**: Tests MCP tools (`create_issue`, `get_issue`, `update_issue`, `search`) alongside tracker sync functionality

The tests verify the entire request/response cycle, including authentication, data validation, and service logic. They run automatically in the CI/CD pipeline against dynamically created test environments.

### UI Tests

UI functional tests are written using Playwright. They simulate user actions, such as logging in, navigating the application, and interacting with UI elements. The tests are configured to record screenshots and generate videos on failure.

## Production Smoke Tests

Production smoke tests are designed to perform a quick, high-level check to ensure that the production and staging environments are up and running. They simulate a standard user workflow to verify that the core functionality is working as expected.

### Schedule

Smoke tests are run on a schedule (e.g., every hour) and are configured to send notifications if the tests fail.

## Continuous fuzzing

Native Go fuzz targets exercise MCP event-stream parsing and canonical audit/evidence
JSON. Relevant PRs run bounded mutations; nightly jobs explore longer and retain
crash inputs. See [fuzzing budgets, local commands, and triage](docs/fuzzing.md).
